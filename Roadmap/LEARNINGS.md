# Learnings — operating notes for every build

**Read this at the start of every session.** It's the distilled, cross-cutting wisdom from past
epics' retrospectives — the things that would have saved the last agent time. The full story of any
item lives in its epic's `RETROSPECTIVE.md`; this file keeps only the *transferable* rule.

**How this file stays useful (Definition of Done, epic):** at epic close, promote any durable,
generalizable learning from your `RETROSPECTIVE.md` into the right section below — a one-liner + a
*why* + the date/source. **Dedupe** (sharpen the existing line, don't append a near-duplicate). If a
rule here is now wrong, fix or delete it. Keep it short — a long digest is an unread digest.

**TEMPLATE NOTE:** the entries below are a curated, generalized subset carried over from the origin
project (`dobby-foundation`'s own extraction) — the tooling/process gotchas that don't depend on any
particular stack. As you build this project, your own entries will accumulate here; keep the same
one-liner + why + date shape.

## Multi-agent & async deploy coordination
*If several agents work in parallel on their own branches, against repos that deploy independently.*

- **A push triggered by a merge to `main` races the deploy of that same merge.** board-sinks-and-scrumban S1 changed
  the push contract and the workflow that pushes on merge in one PR: the first two pushes reached the OLD route, which
  dropped the new `board` block, and the board stayed stale until the next event re-pushed. When a merge changes both a
  route and a client that calls it on merge, either make the client wait for the deployment (`deployment_status`), or
  make the payload one the old route accepts in full and verify after the deploy. *(2026-10-02.)*
- **A committed generated file cannot hold facts that move without a commit — nor sort by them.** BUILD-ORDER.md
  could not carry Building/QA (they move on a branch push, not a commit), and its Shipped section, sorted by git dates,
  reordered itself in CI's depth-1 clone and failed the freshness guard. Committed output sorts by committed data
  (build order); live facts go to a gitignored snapshot. *(board-sinks-and-scrumban S1, 2026-10-02.)*
- **Rollout ORDER is part of a cross-repo feature's design, not an afterthought — the receiver must
  hold the shared secret before delivery is enabled.** event-destination-router delivers to a
  Miyagi endpoint that fails **closed** (401) when its `GOLDEN_BEANS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is unset, and
  Golden Beans classifies 401 as a **permanent** 4xx → immediate dead-letter. So flipping
  `DESTINATION_DELIVERY_ENABLED` before the secret reached Miyagi's Cloud Run would have
  dead-lettered the entire queued backlog in one pass, unrecoverable except by operator replay. The
  correct order (2026-07-22): (1) secret into the receiver **and verified loaded** — the fail-closed
  body (`Unauthorized`) differs from the bad-signature body (`Invalid signature`), so "is the secret
  live?" is observable without a valid signature; (2) create the destination **born disabled**;
  (3) a hand-signed test delivery while still dark; (4) enable; (5) flip the flag. **Generate the
  shared secret yourself** so both sides match — the producer UI's mint-and-show-once path otherwise
  creates a chicken-and-egg with the consumer's env.
- **Vercel production env vars are write-only (sensitive by default) and need a REBUILD to reach
  running functions — and the rebuild must be a commit to `main`, not `vercel redeploy`** (AGENTS
  rule #4). `vercel env pull` returning an empty value for a var you just set is expected, not a
  failure. Verify the flip against the running endpoint's behavior, never against a pull.
  **Corollary — `vercel env run` can load the repo's existing `.env.local` over the requested
  production environment.** Entity-journeys S3 requested Production and silently received
  `SUPABASE_URL=127.0.0.1`; check only the selected hostname before trusting the process. Never rename
  or overwrite the user's local file to work around it. For an authorized production proof, the
  linked `supabase db query --linked` Management API can mint a one-use key/token, normal HTTP ingest
  can exercise the real path, and a `finally` cleanup can revoke both—without pulling a service-role
  secret into the shell.

- **`main` moves under you.** Before opening a PR — and again if it sits open — **merge latest `main`
  into your branch**. Tell-tale: CI fails on a spec/check for something you never touched → a sibling
  agent landed something on `main` and your preview (if you have one) predates it. **A re-run alone
  won't fix it** — the mismatch is structural; only `git merge origin/main` + push clears it. Confirm
  with `git log HEAD..origin/main`.
  **Corollary — the stale-vs-fresh mismatch can hit your own NEW code too, not just an untouched
  check, when a sibling PR changes a shared file's CONVENTIONS (a lint rule, not a feature).** The
  diagnostic tell: check whether a FAILING assertion is about a rule/convention that changed, not just
  a feature/data mismatch.
- **Announce cross-cutting or direct-to-`main` changes**, and prefer a PR even for "engine" features.
  Anything touching shared surface — a root layout/middleware file, global styles, `package.json`/deps,
  a new sibling worktree — can break every other open PR.
- **Don't yank a shared branch out from under another agent.** If the repo's working tree is on
  someone else's branch, do your change in an isolated `git worktree` instead of switching it.
  **Corollary — checking CI status and merging a PR need no local checkout at all.** `gh pr checks <N>`
  and `gh pr merge <N>` operate against the pushed remote branch via the GitHub API; they don't care
  what's checked out locally.
- **Before building a story, grep whether a sibling PR already fixed the identical root cause.** Two
  epics approved the same day can target the same bug from different scope docs. Check
  `git log --oneline -- <the file the story's root-cause names>` + `gh pr list` during research, not
  assumed.
- **Risk tier decides who merges**: low-risk → the reviewer/agent may merge on green CI; anything
  touching money / auth / DB / shared infra → the product owner merges. When unsure, treat as high.
  **Corollary — an explicit "merge on green" authorization changes who decides to pause and check in,
  not whether the review layers themselves still run.** "Merge on green" is permission to proceed
  through the established gate without re-asking at each step, not permission to skip the gate.
  **Corollary — a "merge on green" given for one PR does not carry forward to a LATER PR in the same
  session/epic, even a similarly-scoped one**, and a builder's own plan can promise a review step the
  standing authorization never touched. Re-check whether a standing "merge on green" was given for
  *this* PR/story, not just somewhere earlier in the conversation.
  **Corollary — a broad wrap-up instruction ("wrap up all around as per process", "yes, proceed")
  authorizes the ORDINARY steps of that process, not a categorically more consequential action
  inside it** — a production deploy, or fetching/printing a live secret key to mint a new
  credential. Hit live in growth-engine-v1 S4: "merge on green" clearly covered the PR merge, but
  "wrap up all around as per process" was not read as covering the `vercel --prod` deploy that
  followed, nor a later credential-fetch to seed a disposable smoke-test row — both got blocked
  after the fact and needed the product owner to name each action specifically, even after a
  generic "yes you are authorized to proceed." Don't assume a broad wrap-up instruction cascades
  into deploy/credential territory — surface each such step by name and let the product owner opt
  in to it specifically. *(2026-07-16, growth-engine-v1 S4.)*
- **When your branch is BEHIND `main`, the two-dot `git diff main..HEAD` lies — read the three-dot.**
  Two-dot compares tips directly, so it folds in the *inverse* of every commit `main` gained since you
  branched (a sibling epic's new files show up as "deletions" in your diff — alarming and wrong).
  Review with **three-dot `git diff main...HEAD`** (merge-base→HEAD = only your changes), and **merge
  `origin/main` into the branch before merging the PR** so the merged tree is what actually ships.
- **A squash-merged sprint branch is a dead end — start the next sprint on a FRESH branch off `main`.**
  A squash-merged PR's individual commits aren't on `main` (only the one squash commit is), so
  continuing that branch for the next sprint re-introduces a messy duplicate diff and can't
  fast-forward. Branch clean off `origin/main` for each new sprint. **Corollary: when a PR is STACKED on the
  one you're merging, merge the base with a merge commit, not a squash.** The stacked branch keeps its ancestry,
  retargets to `main` with only its own diff, and needs no rebase. *(golden-frijoles-plugin, 2026-09-23)*
- **To verify "is the prior sprint serving?", reason off `origin/main` — never the working tree — and
  read PR *state*, not branch commits.** Local app checkouts routinely sit on *other* agents'
  branches, so on-disk files lie about `main`, and a squash-merged sprint's individual commits
  genuinely aren't on `main`. Confirm with `gh pr view <#> --json state,mergeCommit` or `git fetch`
  then `git grep <x> origin/main` — an `ls`/working-tree read is not evidence about `main`.
- **Concurrent planning commits in a shared worktree collide the git index.** Fix: (1) **path-limited
  commits** — `git add <your files>` + `git commit -- <those paths>`, never `git add -A`; (2) for
  parallel planning, give each session its own worktree, or appoint a single **scribe** for shared
  files (like `BUILD-ORDER.md`).
  **Sharpened 2026-09-01 — the worst thing `git add -A` sweeps up is not a sibling's file, it is
  YOUR OWN deliberate breakage.** A mutation check (CODE-QUALITY §5) means the tree is *supposed* to
  hold a reverted fix for a minute at a time; a review pass means several of those in a row. `git
  add -A` during that minute commits the revert, under a commit message that says the defect was
  fixed — so the branch carries the defect and the claim that it does not, and every later reader
  believes the message. It happened **twice in one epic** (`design-system-rails` `d677868` and
  `bddfdfc`, identical titles), and both times CI was what noticed, not the agent. The recovery is
  *copy the file back*, never `git checkout <file>`, which discards the uncommitted work you were
  mid-way through. Stage by path, always — the rule is not about tidiness, it is about not
  publishing a lie about your own diff.
- **A subagent/fork that dies mid-task from a shared session rate-limit still returns a `result` — that
  text is its last tool-call narration, not a trustworthy completion claim.** After any subagent/fork
  batch — especially one large enough to plausibly share a rate-limit, or any showing a failed status —
  re-derive actual file state directly (grep the real repo) and run the language's type-checker/build
  before treating the batch as complete.
  **Sharpened 2026-07-25 — the danger is not just an INCOMPLETE task, it is a HALF-APPLIED one, and
  the worst case is a security mutation left in the tree.** A subagent writing the unit-test layer was
  instructed to mutation-check each spec (break the line, confirm red, revert). It died from a session
  rate-limit *between the break and the revert*, leaving
  `apps/web/lib/webhook-signature.ts` with `timingSafeEqual` swapped for `a === b` — timing-attack
  protection silently removed — while its returned `result` read as ordinary progress ("Now mutation
  8..."). Nothing failed; the tests passed, because the mutation was functionally equivalent for
  equality. **So the check after any delegated batch is `git diff HEAD` for SOURCE files the task had
  no business modifying, not just "did the new files appear".** A task that deliberately mutates code
  as part of its method must be assumed to have left a mutation behind, and any agent asked to
  mutation-check should be told to revert-then-verify-clean as its final step. *(2026-07-25, the
  quality-rails epic.)*
- **When you delegate a whole epic, do the SHARED-SURFACE work yourself and FIRST.** CI config, lint
  config, `package.json`, a `lib/` seam several stories import: every branch opened after it inherits
  it, and every branch opened before it conflicts with it. Sequencing it first is what makes parallel
  story agents safe. Corollary: read-only research over a large or foreign codebase is the ideal
  parallel-background task (no write conflicts at all) — and ask it for an explicit **"NOT DERIVABLE"
  list**, because an honest gap is far more useful than an optimistic guess and is the thing you most
  need before designing against someone else's data. *(2026-07-25.)*
- **Before setting a production env var, confirm which rail is *actually* serving production traffic —
  don't assume it's the one named in the project's original deploy docs.** Set `GROWTH_ENGINE_URL`/
  `GROWTH_ENGINE_API_KEY` on Vercel's production scope for a consumer whose frontend had silently
  moved to Cloud Run days earlier (a sibling epic's own cutover); the vars never reached the running
  site, and the fire-and-forget forwarder (correctly) no-op'd on every real request with zero error —
  looked identical to "not yet triggered" until a live smoke + a direct `gcloud run services describe`
  env-var diff caught it. Check the live service's actual env, not the platform you assume is prod,
  before wiring a new integration into someone else's already-shipped surface. **Corollary — an
  incremental `gcloud run services update --update-env-vars/--update-secrets` is far safer than
  reconstructing a full `gcloud run deploy` from a hand-crafted script you don't have every value for**
  (the full command replaces the ENTIRE env/secret set; a missing default silently clobbers unrelated
  production config). Patch live incrementally, then separately fix the deploy script's source so the
  NEXT full redeploy doesn't regress it — two commits, not one risky one.
- **"Reads Miyagi's Supabase" is not one fact — a sibling system can have MULTIPLE databases wearing
  similar names, and only ONE of them is actually a Supabase project.** Growth Engine v1 S3 assumed
  `financial_event` (a Medusa CORE MODULE table) was reachable the same way `platform_flags` is — via
  Supabase's REST API with a service-role key — because both "live in Miyagi." Wrong: `platform_flags`
  lives in a small auxiliary Supabase project (`xljxqymsuyhlnorfrnno`, confirmed via medusa-bonsai's
  own `LEARNINGS.md` — this project is ALSO shared between local dev and production, no separate
  staging DB, unlike Stripe/GCP-style credentials); Medusa's own commerce/module tables (including
  `financial_event`) live in Medusa's PRIMARY Postgres, a completely different database reached via a
  plain connection string (`DATABASE_URL`, GCP Secret Manager, project `miyagisanchezback-497722` —
  a **Cloud SQL instance** (`medusa-pg`), confirmed via `gcloud sql instances list`; the sibling
  `NEON_BACKUP_DSN` secret is just a backup destination, NOT the primary DB — an initial guess this
  meant "Neon-hosted" was wrong and corrected here, exactly the kind of assumption worth verifying
  rather than inferring from a secret's name), not Supabase's REST API at all. The failure was loud
  and immediate ("table not found in schema cache"), not silent — but it still cost a full round-trip
  before the real fix (swap `@supabase/supabase-js` for a raw `pg` client). **Before writing ANY
  cross-repo read, confirm which physical database a specific table lives in — don't infer it from a
  sibling table's access pattern, even one in the "same" system, AND don't infer a provider from a
  secret's name either.** `gcloud secrets list --project=<gcp-project>` (names only, no values) is a
  safe, narrow way to discover what credentials actually exist for a sibling system before assuming a
  shape from docs; `gcloud sql instances list` (also names/metadata only) confirms the actual DB
  provider/networking. *(2026-07-15, growth-engine-v1 S3.)*
- **A correct connection string can still be network-unreachable — "credentials exist" and "you can
  reach the host" are two separate facts.** Continuing the S3 story above: even with the right
  `DATABASE_URL`, connecting from outside GCP hung indefinitely rather than erroring (`medusa-pg` has
  `ipv4Enabled: False` — no public IP, VPC-private only, confirmed via `gcloud sql instances list`'s
  `IPV4_ENABLED` column). A **local Cloud SQL Auth Proxy tunnel did NOT fix this** — the proxy only
  bridges the IAM/discovery layer; it still needs an actual network path (VPN/Interconnect) into that
  VPC, which didn't exist from this environment. **The only fix for a private-IP-only Cloud SQL
  instance is running from somewhere already inside that VPC** — a one-off Cloud Run Job attached to
  the SAME VPC connector a real service already uses (found via `gcloud run services describe
  <service> --format="value(...vpc-access-connector)"` on the sibling system's own backend service,
  never guessed) is a clean, temporary way to do this: deploy with `--vpc-connector`/`--vpc-egress`,
  bind secrets directly via `--set-secrets` (Cloud Run reads them from Secret Manager at runtime — the
  agent never has to fetch/hold the plaintext value at all), run once, then delete the job AND any
  container images Cloud Build produced (`gcloud artifacts docker images list/delete`) AND revert any
  IAM binding added just to make it work — a temporary job should leave zero standing resources or
  permissions behind. **Symptom to watch for:** a DB connection that HANGS (no error at all) rather
  than failing is the tell for "unreachable network," not "wrong credentials" (which fails fast) — set
  a short `connectionTimeoutMillis`/equivalent immediately when diagnosing, don't wait on the default.
  *(2026-07-15, growth-engine-v1 S3.)*
- **A script with a co-located pure-logic test file MUST guard its `main()` call with an `isMain`
  check.** Importing a script that calls `main()` unconditionally at module scope re-executes the
  whole script for real (shell-outs, notifications, git pushes, all of it) the moment a test file
  loads it for its pure helpers: `const isMain = process.argv[1] && …; if (isMain) main()`.
- **Run the repo binaries directly when `npm`/`npx` chokes.** A sibling worktree that reuses the same
  `package.json` name as the main checkout breaks npm **workspace resolution** at the monorepo root.
  Use the binary path directly (`node /…/node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit`,
  `/…/node_modules/.bin/{next,playwright}`). New worktrees should use a unique package name or be
  excluded from the root `workspaces` glob.
- **A worktree needing its own `npm install` forces worktree-local binaries for everything, including
  test runners.** A fresh `git worktree` resolves most tooling fine via walk-up to the root
  `node_modules`, but if any dependency needs a local install (e.g. a CSS framework's PostCSS plugin
  resolution), that install adds a worktree-local copy of your test framework too — switch to the
  **worktree-local** binary path, or you'll hit "two different versions" / "No tests found" errors.
- **`gh pr merge --delete-branch` fails when a worktree holds `main`.** The merge still succeeds on
  GitHub; only the local branch-delete errors. Verify with `gh pr view <n> --json state`.
- **A server-side `process.env.X ?? \`https://${req.headers.get('host')}\`` fallback is a real
  production landmine, distinct from client-bundle build-time-inlining bugs.** The trap is the
  Host-header fallback when the env var is unset: a bare container run without an explicit runtime env
  var can get a literal `0.0.0.0:PORT` or similar garbage as the `Host` header, and the fallback
  happily builds a broken URL from it — dangerous on any redirect-URL-building code path (OAuth
  callbacks, payment-provider return URLs). Fix: one shared `resolveOrigin()`-style helper that
  rejects obviously-wrong hosts and **throws instead of silently building a broken URL** — a loud
  failure beats a dead redirect.
- **A unit-tested pure helper can't live in the same file as code that imports a framework/runtime-only
  module** (e.g. a Next.js `next/cache` import, or an auth SDK's server-only entrypoint). A generic
  test runner that can't load that module throws an opaque, unrelated-looking error the moment it
  imports the file at all — even if the pure function itself never touches the framework-only code.
  Keep the pure logic in its own zero-import file; let the framework-touching wrapper import *it*.
- **Swapping a framework-generated artifact for a hand-rolled route breaks specs on exact format.**
  Converting a typed/generated file (robots.txt, sitemap, OG image, metadata) to a hand-rolled
  equivalent can silently change output details (header casing, field order) that an existing spec
  asserted on. When you replace anything a framework generates, diff the *exact bytes* the old one
  emitted and grep the suite for any spec asserting that surface.
- **CI sometimes just doesn't schedule a workflow for a PR.** Seen occasionally on `opened`; close/
  reopen doesn't always fix it — an empty-commit push (a real `synchronize` event) does. Don't merge
  on an absent gate: re-trigger, and lean on the local gate + a green preview as the real signal.
- **`node --test <dir>` (bare directory) can silently fail to discover tests depending on your Node
  version** — it may try to load the directory as a module instead of globbing it. Use an explicit
  glob: `node --test 'scripts/lib/*.test.mjs'`.
- **A "resolve the PR from the current branch" tool must read PR `state`** — a list/view call can
  return MERGED/CLOSED PRs too, especially for a reused branch name whose PR already merged. Treat
  `state !== 'OPEN'` as "no open PR for this branch" and pair it with a stale-HEAD guard
  (`git rev-parse HEAD` vs the PR's `headRefOid` → warn + require an explicit override) so the first
  run always reviews the current diff.
- **A hosted CLI-authenticated integration (Vercel-style env-var management, similar platforms) can
  silently store or report EMPTY values** through a convenience CLI command even when the underlying
  API call "succeeds." Verify by value **length** where you can't read the value directly (a scoped
  read token may be needed), not just by exit code. **Reproduced again (2026-07-16, commercial-shell
  Sprint 2):** `echo -n "value" | vercel env add NAME production` saved an empty string; explicit
  `vercel env add NAME production --value "value"` is the reliable non-interactive form — pipe-to-stdin
  isn't. Mark a var `--no-sensitive` at creation if it isn't actually secret (a public URL, a feature
  flag) — sensitive-flagged vars can't be read back via `vercel env pull`/`env ls` at all (by design,
  not a bug), so there is no way to verify them short of provider dashboard or live app behavior.
- **A "sensitive"/write-only secret is confirmable by presence/type but not by value** — you can check
  it exists and which environment it targets, but not its actual content, from a CLI or API. Read the
  provider's dashboard, or have the app surface the cause on use (missing key → a specific, classifiable
  error) instead of guessing. **The most reliable verification, when the var isn't secret, is neither
  the dashboard nor the CLI — it's exercising the actual live behavior it controls** (e.g. curl the
  page/route that reads it and check what it renders), which also sidesteps ever needing to pull a
  full env file (including unrelated real secrets) just to confirm one var.
- **When a repo's GitHub↔deploy-platform integration is already connected, a manual CLI deploy
  (`vercel deploy --prod`, etc.) is an out-of-band action that bypasses the git-tracked pipeline —
  don't reach for it to "make a deploy happen."** Confirm what's actually live via the platform's own
  record of the integration (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/deployments` shows the exact commit SHA and
  status per environment) instead of assuming a manual deploy is needed. Env-var-only changes may take
  effect on already-deployed functions with no redeploy at all (observed 2026-07-16) — don't assume a
  fresh deploy is required before checking.
  **CORRECTION (2026-07-21, multi-tenant-activation launch): that "no redeploy" observation does NOT
  generalize, and betting on it costs you a confusing debugging session.** Adding `SIGNUP_ENABLED`
  to Vercel's Production scope left `/signup` returning 404 for 7+ minutes, because Vercel snapshots
  env vars into a deployment at BUILD time and running functions keep serving the values captured at
  their own build. **Treat "env var set" and "env var live" as two separate facts**: setting it is
  half the job, a new deployment (here: a commit to `main`) is what makes it take effect. The
  reliable check is always exercising the behaviour the var controls — a CLI listing shows presence,
  never effect.
- **A local checkout's `node_modules` goes stale the moment a merged PR adds a new dependency** —
  `git pull`-ing the merge commit updates `package.json` on disk but not `node_modules`, so a local
  `tsc`/`build` can fail with `Cannot find module` for code that builds fine everywhere else (CI
  already ran `npm ci` fresh; the hosting platform's build does too). `npm ci` before trusting a local
  build failure as a real regression.
- **Driving a young foreign CLI: run `<cli> --help` first, pin the version, and design for degrade —
  never build against a documented flag from memory.** A less-mature CLI can have surprising interface
  shapes (no JSON output mode, arguments only via argv not stdin, or vice versa) that don't match a
  more mainstream CLI's conventions. Smoke-test by running it against something real and reading the
  actual output before scripting around it.
  **A young foreign CLI can silently break its own contract on a MINOR version bump** — a print mode
  that used to always emit something can start exiting 0 with empty output on a real failure. Treat
  **empty output as failure** (not success), and make any version-pin check **fail loud** so a
  contract break gets caught, not silently absorbed.
  **A CLI authed by an interactive/OAuth login is NOT free to run in CI** — confirm a portable
  non-interactive credential path AND its cost before automating it in a runner; some CLIs have no
  headless auth at all, which may mean an advisory/local-only tool stays local-only rather than
  becoming a CI job.
- **`process.exit()` truncates piped stdout — flush synchronously, or you ship a tool that works to a
  file but crashes in a pipe.** A script that does `console.log(json); process.exit(0)` can produce
  valid output when redirected to a file (sync writes) but truncated output down a pipe, because the
  async stdout write hasn't drained when exit fires. Use a synchronous write before `process.exit`, or
  exit in the write callback. Test a tool the way it's actually invoked (pipe, not just file redirect).
- **Git background auto-maintenance can race a burst of rapid commits and leave stale `*.lock`
  files**, producing intermittent "cannot lock ref" errors. Clear locks recursively
  (`find .git -name '*.lock'`) and run a rapid-commit batch with `git -c gc.auto=0 commit …` so
  auto-maintenance can't re-trigger mid-sequence.
- **A delta-only reporting tool must special-case a missing/wiped baseline as a bounded no-op, never as
  "everything happened."** Diffing current state against an empty/`null` previous snapshot makes every
  historical item look "new" — guard for a missing baseline with ONE bounded summary (counts only)
  instead of enumerating full history, and keep a message-length safety net regardless of the guard.
- **A script with both scheduled state-tracking delivery and on-demand artifact generation must keep
  the artifact mode stateless.** Reusing a stateful window/log rail for an on-demand report mode risks
  silently advancing state a scheduled run depends on — keep on-demand modes explicitly
  non-state-mutating and lock that with a test.

- **Moving a control is not one change — it is a change plus everything that pointed at it.** In one
  epic, FOUR things were nearly removed before their replacement existed: the definitions stack
  (hidden a sprint before the destination), rollback (the per-version buttons were the only way to
  serve an older version), the authoring form (gated along with the credential forms it shared a JSX
  block with), and a spec still driving mint/revoke at the old URL. Three were capability losses; the
  fourth was a COVERAGE loss, which is the same defect in disguise — the flow would have had zero
  automated cover at exactly the moment it became reachable at a new address. **The rule: land the
  replacement and retire the original in the SAME story**, and before retiring anything, enumerate
  what the old surface did and name each item's new home. Any other ordering has a window where the
  capability does not exist. *(2026-08-26, flags-console-parity.)*
- **A constraint you cannot immediately justify is not thereby unjustified.** An architecture
  amendment said "this sprint does not edit `flag-manager.tsx`." It was weakened mid-build with
  careful-looking reasoning — four lines, default preserved, gate-off render unchanged — and the
  weakening WAS the defect: that file held every activate/deactivate control, whose replacement was a
  sprint away. Before removing a constraint, find the failure it was written to prevent; failing to
  find it is a reason to look harder, not a licence to proceed. *(2026-08-26, flags-console-parity.)*
- **A PR that CONFLICTS with its base silently stops CI from creating any run.** Not queued, not
  failed — absent, while other event types still fire and every workflow reads `state: active`. It
  presents exactly like a quota outage, and on a public repo (unlimited minutes) that diagnosis is
  wrong. `gh pr view <N> --json mergeable` FIRST; the tell is in the timeline, not the symptom — an
  outage starts when the provider breaks, a conflict starts when you push the commit that creates it.
  Expect it after every stacked merge, and rebase the children immediately.
  *(2026-08-25, flags-console-parity.)*

## Review quality

- **A lock decision is most at risk in the NEXT sprint's convenience code.** D19 said "the Hub never computes a
  stage" and S2's board obeyed it; S4's Roadmap tab, written for a different story, quietly derived stages from the old
  `status` field for pre-stage pushes, and linked them to cards the board could not open. Before building a view, grep
  the lock for the rules about its data, not only its story. *(board-sinks-and-scrumban S4, 2026-10-02.)*
- **A mutation check that breaks the BUILD proves nothing — confirm the mutated code compiled before
  reading "no failing test" as "the guard is weak".** Three times in golden-frijoles-cli a mutation
  left a symbol unused; lint failed inside `next build`, no test ran, and the result read exactly
  like a guard that survived its mutation. Mutate with a change that compiles AND lints (keep the
  symbol referenced, weaken the condition), and check the run actually built before scoring it.
  *(2026-09-17, golden-frijoles-cli S1–S3.)*
  **On a tenancy path, mutate the ONE legal read itself** (board-sinks-and-scrumban S4, 2026-10-02): the workspace
  board's specs went red when each 404 guard was removed, and stayed green when `getWorkspaceProjects()` was swapped for
  "every project in the workspace" — the one mutation the invariant exists to forbid. A fresh reviewer found it. The
  spec that catches it seeds a sibling project in the viewer's OWN workspace, with a real pushed board, and the viewer
  not a member.
  **The same holds for a "not found" assertion** (one-epic-page S2, 2026-10-07): a spec that a flag key reads "not found"
  proves nothing about tenancy when the key exists in NO project. Put the key in a sibling the viewer even owns, and
  mutate the read's project filter — that is the run that must go red.
- **A guard written to satisfy a rule is not exempt from that rule — check WHAT refused the write,
  not just that something did.** A spec written because a migration's comment claimed "asserted by
  attempting the writes" passed a random `user_id`, so the forged INSERT failed on the FOREIGN KEY
  rather than the grant; restoring `GRANT INSERT` left it green. A database refusal can come from
  any constraint — the fixture must make the property under test the ONLY thing that can refuse.
  *(2026-09-17, golden-frijoles-cli S1.)*
- **When the same function draws a finding in round after round, stop enumerating cases and
  change the rule.** `gf init`'s key reuse took four review rounds, each fix covering one more
  "safe unverified" branch and leaving another — because there were none. The fix that held was the
  one that made the class unrepresentable: reuse only when verified; otherwise refuse. A narrowing
  trail of findings in ONE function is the signal, distinct from convergence across a PR.
  *(2026-09-17, golden-frijoles-cli S1, rounds 1/4/6/7.)*
- **What the suite cannot reach is where the defects live — list it, then reach it.** Four review
  rounds and 1800 green tests shipped an interactive `gf login` that hung after Enter, because a
  piped test cannot exercise a TTY; it was found by review and verified by driving the built binary
  under a real pty (`expect`). The epic's HEADLINE command returned 400 until an end-to-end spec ran
  it against the real parser — every unit test had supplied the optional field the parser requires.
  For a new surface, name the layer no test touches (a TTY, the real parser, `jsonb` round-trips)
  before calling the gate complete. *(2026-09-17, golden-frijoles-cli.)*
- **A truncated review posts as a clean pass — guard the SHAPE of the output, not just its
  presence.** A reviewer CLI exhausted its turn budget mid-read and exited 0 with a bare
  `read_file{…}` tool call as its entire output. The runner's guards (non-zero status, empty output)
  both passed, so it was posted, where it renders as a review that found nothing. That is worse than
  an empty result: an empty one looks wrong and gets investigated; a truncated one silently drops a
  whole family from the gate on the PR it was reviewing. Detect by shape — output starting with a
  bare tool call, or missing the findings heading the prompt requires. *(2026-08-25.)*
- **Feed reviewers the PR HEAD, never the working tree.** `cross-review.mjs` attached whole-file
  context with `readFileSync`, so reviewing a PR while checked out on its stacked child handed the
  reviewer one branch's diff beside another branch's files — and produced a confident Blocking
  finding that the diff "would not compile." With stacked sprint branches as the default shape this
  is routine, not exotic. When a file cannot be read at the head, OMIT it rather than substituting: a
  reviewer that cannot see a file says so, one shown the WRONG file states defects that do not exist.
  *(2026-08-25.)*
- **Check a reviewer's SEVERITY estimate against live data, not just its mechanism.** A fresh
  reviewer found that the console equated "an activation row exists" with "the feature is on" and
  rated live likelihood "medium", reasoning that few flags had been re-versioned. Production said the
  latest version of **34 of 42** flags evaluated `false` — the common case, not the corner. It was
  right about the mechanism and wrong about the blast radius, in the direction that sounds safe.
  *(2026-08-26, flags-console-parity.)*
- **A reviewer can be handed a STALE diff, and it is indistinguishable from a confident wrong
  finding — the tell is cheap.** Twice in one PR, agy reported issues that were already fixed and
  pushed, quoting the pre-fix source verbatim; once it claimed a test failed that was green at the
  reviewed SHA. **Check whether the code quoted in the finding exists in `origin` at that SHA before
  accepting OR dismissing it.** The same reviewer's other rounds on that PR produced five real
  defects, so reflex-dismissing would have been expensive. *(2026-08-20, site-url-preview-aware.)*
- **A source-scanning guard keyed on SYNTAX is an allow-list of shapes; key it on the one thing every
  form must contain.** A caller-discovery test matched `import { x } from '…'` and two dynamic
  shapes — so a namespace import, a renamed binding, an explicit `.ts` extension (which this repo's
  own tests use) and a differently-written dynamic import all added callers invisibly. Keying on the
  module SPECIFIER cannot be dodged by syntax. The residual hole — a barrel re-export routing callers
  around the sweep — was closed by **prohibiting the barrel** rather than detecting it, which is the
  cheaper half of "make the failure unrepresentable". *(2026-08-20, site-url-preview-aware.)*
- **Fixing a review finding introduced a worse one, and the guard's own second half caught it.**
  Replacing a hardcoded directory allow-list with a deny-list matched bare directory names at ANY
  depth, so `public` skipped `app/api/v1/public/` as well as `apps/web/public` — silently dropping a
  DURABLE call site out of discovery. The companion "registry names a file that no longer imports
  this" test went red immediately. **A discovery guard needs a second assertion pointing the other
  way**, or its coverage can shrink to nothing while it reports success. *(2026-08-20,
  site-url-preview-aware.)*
- **Nine review rounds on a nine-line fix, and most late findings were bugs in the previous round's
  fix.** The pattern LEARNINGS records for concurrency work holds for source-scanning guards too: a
  dead import passing the gate check · import shapes escaping discovery · a `[\s\S]*?` span
  swallowing code between two imports · trailing `//` comments defeating a `$` anchor · trailing
  `/* … */` doing the same · a case-sensitive scheme strip. Every one looked right and reported
  success. **Budget for this shape when the deliverable IS a guard** — the code under test was
  trivial and the guard around it was not. *(2026-08-20, site-url-preview-aware.)*
  **Give the parser a third answer, "can't read this", and make it fail red.** In
  cli-think-skills-followups the body-order guard recorded a destructured `{ body }` parameter, a comment and a rest
  parameter as "takes no parameter" and passed. Only a literal `()` may mean none; anything the parser can't name is
  its own state, and the guard refuses it. Three review rounds on a test-only story again, none on the product code.
  *(2026-10-04, cli-think-skills-followups.)*
- **A platform-set environment variable is not a request Host header, and the difference is worth
  making STRUCTURAL.** AGENTS rule #5 forbids a `Host` fallback because a bare-container Host is
  attacker-controllable. `VERCEL_BRANCH_URL` is set by the platform into the deployment, is identical
  for every request it serves, and no caller can influence it. Extracting the decision into
  `resolveSiteUrl(env)` — a pure function with no request in scope — turned "we promise not to read
  headers" into "there is nothing here to read". Say this loudly in the source, or the next reader
  reverts it citing the rule. *(2026-08-20, site-url-preview-aware.)*
- **`vercel env ls` before designing, not after.** One command established that Supabase and every
  relevant gate are Production-scoped, which meant the dangerous call sites were already unreachable
  on previews — turning the epic's hardest design question into an observation and avoiding a
  two-function split that would have drifted within a quarter. **When a change's safety depends on
  what an environment can reach, go and read the environment.** And write down that the property is
  environmental and therefore fragile, because a test in the repo cannot see it change.
  *(2026-08-20, site-url-preview-aware.)*
- **`format-changed.mjs` without `PRETTIER_BASE_REF` reports "no added files" and EXITS 0.** A green
  that means nothing was checked. CI sets the base ref and failed on files a local run had silently
  skipped. Second epic to pay for "a local gate that is a subset of CI's is worse than no local
  gate" — the fix is to invoke CI's own scripts *with CI's own environment*.
  *(2026-08-20, site-url-preview-aware.)*
  Third epic, sharpened (result-record, 2026-10-07): the gate checks **new** files, so a branch that adds files must
  run `PRETTIER_BASE_REF=origin/main node scripts/format-changed.mjs` before each push; two new files went red once each.


- **Borrow the register, never the motion — and state the translation rule before anyone writes a
  line.** Copy from enterprise job posts (lock-in, capacity constraints, governance, spend control,
  future-proofing as models evolve) transferred cleanly onto a maker product *because the epic wrote
  down, up front, which ideas were taken and which were left* — procurement, RFPs, seat expansion,
  "the world's largest organizations". Every borrowed phrase was re-pointed at one person and their
  agents. Without that table the same source produces a page selling to a department that does not
  exist. **A register is portable; a sales motion is not.** *(2026-08-20, agentic-pm-public-surface.)*
- **A written, specced, documented function with NO call site is a liability, not an asset — and the
  tests will hide it.** `handoffPrompt()` shipped in `landing-redesign-v2`, lost its only caller
  when `landing-readability-pass` cut §try, and sat dead for two epics while
  `e2e/landing-prompts.spec.ts` faithfully exercised it every CI run — green, meaningful-looking, and
  testing nothing anybody could reach. A spec passing is not evidence the code is *used*. **When a
  section is deleted, grep the deleted markup for every helper it called and either re-home the
  helper or delete it.** *(2026-08-20, agentic-pm-public-surface.)*
- **Scope the reviewer at the file it could not attach — this is now the second epic where every real
  CSS finding came from a scoped pass.** `globals.css` is 140 KB and exceeds agy's 256 KB argv cap.
  Four unscoped rounds returned clean on a diff whose riskiest change was a stylesheet prune; ONE
  round with `--paths apps/web/app/globals.css` returned four real findings, one of which was a
  whole class of dead rules the prune had never walked. `landing-readability-pass` recorded exactly
  this and it still had to be rediscovered. **Read the attachment line before believing a clean
  round, and re-run scoped at whatever it withheld — reflexively, not as a recovery move.**
  *(2026-08-20, agentic-pm-public-surface.)*
- **A scripted CSS prune needs a PARSED-RULE diff, and it will still be wrong the first time.** Two
  distinct bugs in one prune, neither visible to any test: (1) matching a dead substring against a
  whole rule deleted **12 live selectors** that were grouped with dead ones — `.hero-grid`,
  `.statrow`, `.cards3`, `.proof-grid` all went with `.proof-stack` because they shared a
  `:where(...)` list; (2) the walker only visited TOP-LEVEL blocks, so every dead rule nested inside
  an `@media` survived untouched. The gate was green after both. **Diff the parsed selector set at
  ALL nesting depths, before and after, and assert zero collateral and zero additions** — then
  render the page. *(2026-08-20, agentic-pm-public-surface.)*
- **`git checkout <file>` is not "undo my mutation" — it is "discard uncommitted work on that
  file".** Restoring two mutation checks that way silently threw away Stories 3.2 and 3.3, which had
  been built but not yet committed. Both had to be rebuilt from scratch. The habit that works is a
  file copy taken *before* the mutation (`cp x /tmp/x.bak` … `cp /tmp/x.bak x`), which restores
  exactly what was there rather than what the last commit had. The second occurrence was caught only
  because a spec written earlier in the same sprint went red. **Never revert a mutation with a git
  command while the file carries uncommitted work.** *(2026-08-20, agentic-pm-public-surface.)*
- **A relaxed assertion must be mutation-checked HARDER than the one it replaced, and a "widened"
  guard is where a can't-fail test hides.** Three guards in one epic had to be written twice: a
  copy-button geometry check that compared the icon to the *button* box (a button always has room to
  its right, so it passed with the fix reverted); a host matcher widened to an allow-list that was
  case-SENSITIVE, so `HTTPS://prod.example` walked straight past it — proved by watching a leaked
  uppercase host leave the suite fully green; and a test *named* "…, once" whose body only asserted
  `toContain`. **A test title is a comment: it claims a property and owes the same proof.**
  *(2026-08-20, agentic-pm-public-surface.)*
- **When two locked acceptance criteria genuinely conflict, that is a product-owner decision — and
  the builder's instinct will be the wrong one.** Story 1.2 required a citation "with a link"; the
  pinned safety assertion required "exactly one host". The first resolution preserved the assertion
  by degrading the criterion, because that is the trade that needs no permission. Codex raised it
  Blocking **twice**; escalating produced a third option that was strictly better than either — widen
  the assertion from "how many hosts" (a proxy) to "which hosts" (the actual property), which is
  *stricter*, since a count cannot tell you what it counted. **A proxy assertion blocking a real
  requirement is a sign the proxy is wrong, not that the requirement is.** *(2026-08-20,
  agentic-pm-public-surface.)*
- **Cite third-party source material by title, author and page; never vendor the artefact.** A
  1 MB gated Amplitude PDF was committed to `references/` to satisfy "the source lives in the repo,
  not in a chat log". That is redistribution without permission, and a licence question is not one a
  copy sprint answers by not asking it. A **page-level provenance map** makes every claim checkable
  by anyone holding a legitimate copy, carries no licence question, and is what a reviewer actually
  needs. Caught in cross-family review, not by anyone on the build. *(2026-08-20,
  agentic-pm-public-surface.)*
- **Verify a placement decision by RENDERING it, even when the spec offered you the option you
  picked.** An acceptance criterion said the category definition must appear "where it cannot be
  missed", and offered two slots. The one chosen rendered as the dimmest, smallest text on the page,
  below the CTAs, reading as a footnote to the offer rather than the claim the page rests on. The
  spec was satisfied and the requirement was not. **"Where it cannot be missed" is a claim about
  pixels, and only a screenshot can settle it.** *(2026-08-20, agentic-pm-public-surface.)*

- **A review finding you rejected on sound reasoning can be a correct PREDICTION about code you have
  not written yet.** Antigravity warned that appending rules below `globals.css`'s reduced-motion
  block reintroduces an ordering hazard. The rejection was right about every transition in the file
  — motion is switched off at the SOURCE by zeroing the tokens, so order cannot matter. It was wrong
  within the hour: a `@keyframes` animation does not consult those tokens for its EXISTENCE, only
  its duration, so an unguarded rule won on order and `animation: … both` applied its `from` state
  anyway — a reader who asked for reduced motion would have landed on a chapter at `opacity: 0`.
  **When a reviewer describes a HAZARD rather than a defect, the useful question is not "is this
  broken today" but "what would have to be added for this to break".** Reject the instance; keep the
  hazard. *(2026-08-20, methodology-experience.)*
- **In a large stylesheet, "later wins at equal specificity" is the DEFAULT failure mode, not an edge
  case — and a media query reads as though it ought to win when it does not.** The same cascade
  defect landed three times in one epic in one file: a three-column grid that never applied (the
  page rendered with no rail at all), the animation above, and a desktop override that lost to its
  own base rule. All three were found by review; none by the suite, because each produced correct
  markup and a green gate. The structural fix is adjacency — **a selector gets ONE base block, and
  it goes above every override of it** — and the assertion is on the COMPUTED value at both sides of
  the breakpoint, never on the rule's existence. *(2026-08-20, methodology-experience.)*
- **`:where()` zeroes only its OWN argument — and the version of that rule people write is (0,2,0).**
  `.ds .ds-shell :where(input, …)` is (0,2,0); `:where(.ds .ds-shell) :where(input, …)` is (0,0,0).
  Written the first way, a BASE RESET in the last-loaded stylesheet silently beat three live rules on
  ties — including the ⌘K palette's input on every console route, which would have shipped a
  redesigned command palette inside a story whose acceptance is *"changes no pixel"*. **The comment
  above it claimed (0,0,0), which is how it survived.** A base reset that cannot be out-specified is
  the defect, not the fix, so a specificity FLOOR needs a named exemption for it rather than a
  loosened rule. *(2026-09-01, design-system-rails S6; found by the fresh reviewer.)*
- **The structural gate passes on a page whose stylesheet is entirely missing.** A frame rendered
  `class="ds ds-door"` where every rule is `.ds .ds-…` — a descendant combinator cannot match the
  element carrying the scope class — so the sign-in page rendered top-left on the browser's default
  ground while the visual gate's four assertions all passed: `ds-` classes inside `<main>` ✓, chrome
  budget ✓, no horizontal scroll ✓, status < 400 ✓. Correct markup, correct stylesheet, **no
  relationship between them**. The guard that catches it asserts the RELATIONSHIP —
  `parentElement.closest('.ds')`, never `closest()` on the element itself, which would call the
  broken markup correct — and it was found by rendering the page and looking, after every gate was
  green. *(2026-09-01, design-system-rails S6.)*
- **A number computed from a hand-typed boolean is rigorous about a value nobody checked.**
  `design-system-rails` reported `27/27` design coverage with `outstanding: []`, ratcheted so it
  could never fall — and at least sixteen routes did not resemble their approved design. The
  arithmetic was real; its input was `rendersFromDesignSystem: true`, typed on each manifest row.
  Three things had to be true at once and each is its own lesson: the screenshot layer of the
  contract was never built (and the spec SAID so, in a comment that read as a note rather than as a
  hole); the assertion on 25 of 27 routes was `status < 400` plus "the `<main>` contains at least one
  `ds-` class"; and the old UI had been HIDDEN behind `<details>`, which is invisible to a presence
  check and to a screenshot of a viewport. **The fix is to derive the number from the gate's own
  result, so the only editable direction is forward.** *(2026-09-10, mockups-as-built.)*
- **A screenshot-diff threshold that has to be tuned until the right pages pass is aimed at today's
  pages.** Measured before writing it: the route the epic called CORRECT came out 6.9% from its
  approved PNG and the one it called WRONG came out 6.4%, and the structural metric scored the
  canonical wrong page a perfect match. No threshold separates them. Four causes, none fixable by a
  better metric — the content column differs by construction on every route, the references paint a
  `PROTOTYPE` badge and designer annotations that must never be product UI, they are viewport clips
  of designs twice as tall, and live data is not fixture data. **Assert the facts that survive a
  change of dataset instead**: the ordered block sequence, the tile count, the column labels, the
  primary action's words, and that the number of `<details>` is zero. *(2026-09-10.)*
- **A STRUCTURAL match is not a look, and the gap is where the defects live.** Nine defects in one
  epic were found by opening a page whose signature already agreed with its approved state — a
  timeline rendering as one crammed line because its three lines were `<span>`s inside a `<span>`
  (so every `margin-top` did nothing); a `max-width: 70ch` on a document CONTAINER squeezing every
  table inside it; a grid `minmax(320px, 1fr)` overflowing a 360px phone because that is a track
  FLOOR; a disabled button painted as the chosen one; a chart drawing half its approved line, so
  "enough people" and "no minimum declared" looked identical. **A contract is a floor, not a finish:
  budget looking at the rendered page as a step, not as a courtesy.** *(2026-09-10.)*
- **When a gate says the PAGE is wrong, check the FIXTURE first.** Three routes in one epic reported
  a mismatch and were correct: the tenant had no destinations, one leading input where the design
  draws three, and no pushed artifacts, so four routes rendered EMPTY states. The tell is a diff
  where the built sequence is a plausible empty state of the approved one. A fixture thinner than the
  design cannot tell a correct page from an incorrect one — and seeding it through the product's own
  write path (an RPC, not an INSERT) is what keeps the fixture a state the product can actually
  reach. *(2026-09-10.)*
- **DELETING a flag is mostly about the suites that READ it.** `CONSOLE_SHELL_ENABLED` was six
  `test.skip` conditions away from silence — including the epic's own blocking visual gate. With the
  variable unset everywhere each would have skipped in every run forever and reported green having
  asserted nothing, and **none of it appears in a diff of the flag itself**. This repo had already
  paid twice for the inverse (a flag set NOWHERE and asserted as if lit); this is the same failure
  from the opposite direction. `grep -rn '<FLAG>' apps scripts .github` before deleting, and read
  every hit that is a `skip` condition. *(2026-09-10.)*
- **`close` does not bubble in the DOM — but React DELEGATES it and replays it up the React tree.**
  A `<dialog>` seam wrapped six surfaces, and every manager inside it confirmed its mutation with a
  nested `ConfirmDialog`. Confirming closed the confirmation and then, one React event later, the
  modal around it: the work succeeded and the operator was returned to the page having never seen
  that it had. Guard with `event.target === element` on `onClose`/`onCancel`, the same identity check
  a backdrop-click handler needs. Traced by patching `HTMLDialogElement.prototype.close` and reading
  the stack — the first diagnosis (a missing effect dependency) was WRONG and its explanatory comment
  had to be deleted rather than left beside a working fix. *(2026-09-10.)*
- **CSS written for a block does nothing on an inline element, and it fails SILENTLY.**
  `max-width`, `overflow` and `text-overflow: ellipsis` are all ignored on `display: inline`. A row
  description rendered as a `<span>` therefore never clipped: measured on production, `max-width`
  computed to 429px while the element rendered at 594px, past its own parent and into the next
  column. Its sibling `.ds-row-clip` two hundred lines away already carried `display: block`, so one
  author knew and the other rule was written as if it did. **The runtime check is the only one that
  decides it** — a flex or grid CHILD is blockified by its parent, so three other rules declare no
  `display` and are correct anyway; a static "must declare display" rule fires on the design working.
  Assert the COMPUTED display instead, on every route a suite opens. *(2026-09-10.)*
- **A structural contract can only assert a page's DEFAULT state, so a criterion about a CONTROL can
  go unmet under a green gate.** A story's acceptance said a `+ New …` button opens the approved
  modal; the button opened an inline panel instead, and the route still matched its approved block
  sequence — because the panel only exists after a click the gate never makes, and the default page
  is unchanged either way. Found by pressing the button on production. **Where an acceptance
  criterion is about what a control DOES, the gate that proves it has to press it.** *(2026-09-10.)*
- **Not every fact in a "structural" signature survives a change of dataset — check which ones are
  really data.** A contract generated from an approved prototype asserted `smallplots: 3`, and
  production renders 2 because that tenant has two leading inputs. The page is correct; the number is
  the fixture's. Every other fact in that signature (block order, column labels, the primary action's
  words, `<details>` count) is structure. **A per-item COUNT of something the data produces is not,
  and seeding a fixture to match it makes the gate agree with the fixture rather than the product.**
  *(2026-09-10.)*
- **Read a credential from the DOM, never from a screenshot.** Transcribing a one-time share token
  out of a screenshot got one character wrong; the page then correctly rendered "this link is not
  working", which reads exactly like a product defect. Hashing the transcription and comparing it to
  the stored `key_hash` settled it in one command — worth doing BEFORE reporting a shown-once
  credential as broken. *(2026-09-10.)*
- **Porting a page means porting its MEASUREMENTS.** A third-party iframe shipped at `min-height:
  700px` with its working in the comment — 620 measured to scroll, 860 measured to leave a gap. The
  port re-derived it as 640, below the value already measured as too short, and the booker clipped.
  Re-deriving a number somebody measured, and getting it wrong, is the same defect as a contract
  whose numbers do not reproduce. *(2026-09-01, design-system-rails S6.)*
- **A rule dies only when EVERY selector in its comma list does.** A sweep that removes a rule when
  ANY selector matches took `.eyebrow, .panel-label, .kicker` down with one dead sibling
  (`.surface-note strong`) — silently un-uppercasing three classes live across the public site. The
  check that caught it is cheap and general: **diff what the sweep removed against what it was asked
  to remove.** *(2026-09-01, design-system-rails S6.)*
- **Verify an ABSENCE by enumerating, never by grepping a command's output.** Confirming an env var
  existed in none of three Vercel environments, `vercel env ls | grep` returned "0 matches" because
  the **CLI had errored**. Listing each environment and counting its rows (32 / 11 / 10) is what
  caught it. A grep over a failed command is a false green, and it is indistinguishable from a true
  one. *(2026-09-01, design-system-rails S6.)*
  **Grepping for a VALUE is the same trap one layer down:** a lock recorded "nothing checks the prototype's hash"
  because `git grep 5bc7e24ed5e3d0aa` hit only `APPROVED.md`, while `tokens.test.ts` had pinned it since #128 by reading
  it OUT of `APPROVED.md` with a regex. The claim reached five docs and a code comment before the close-out audit broke
  it by mutating the file. To prove nothing checks X, change X and watch what goes red. *(2026-09-30, sketch-specs.)*
- **Relaxing an assertion to admit a new case can make it certify the wrong page.** Adding a
  legitimately-404 route to a mobile sweep meant accepting `[200, 404]` everywhere — and a
  gate-dependent route that 404s in that harness was then certified "mobile-clean" under a test named
  after the page it never loaded. **Expected status is per-row data**, and a gated route is
  skipped-with-its-reason rather than measured on the page its gate serves. *(2026-09-01,
  design-system-rails S6; found by re-reading my own fix.)*
- **A JSX pragma is per FILE.** Fourteen specs went red at once with one unrelated-looking error
  ("Objects are not valid as a React child") the moment a page component composed a primitive from a
  file lacking `@jsxImportSource react`. A caller carrying the line does nothing for the JSX inside
  what it calls; put it on the shared seam (the icon module, the primitives module) rather than on
  each consumer. *(2026-09-01, design-system-rails S6.)*
- **A guard keyed on INDENTATION breaks when a wrapper element is added.** A spec sliced a component
  by "newline plus exactly eight spaces" and went red because a `<div>` moved every line two columns
  — the second wrong version of that line, after one that matched a substring and silently covered
  two-thirds of the branch. Balance the delimiters instead; depth-counting cannot be fooled by
  either. *(2026-09-01, design-system-rails S6.)*
- **A silently fallen-back reviewer is a DIFFERENT reviewer, and its confidence does not drop.** On
  the passes where agy fell back from `gemini-3.6-flash-high` to `gpt-oss-120b-medium` it filed three
  **Blocking** findings — a duplicate import, a duplicate function, a duplicate helper — that
  `grep -c` disproves in one line each and that a green `tsc` makes impossible. On the passes where
  it did NOT fall back it found two real defects in a guard that had already been mutation-verified.
  **Both halves are the lesson:** the fallback line in the output is the signal to verify every
  finding before acting, and the layer still earns its place. *(2026-09-01, design-system-rails S6.)*
- **`0 did not fit the budget` is not proof the reviewer read anything.** agy's documented 256 KB
  argv cap is not the binding limit — the MODEL gives out well before it, and fails as *garbage
  output* rather than as an error (171 KB returned `agy -p failed: "`; 19 KB reviewed cleanly; the
  same file alone at 119 KB produced three findings including a Blocking). This extends the existing
  "read the attachment line" rule: a clean verdict needs both an attachment line AND a payload the
  model actually digested. Reviewing one large file on its own is a legitimate round.
  *(2026-08-20, methodology-experience.)*
- **A mutation check that does NOT go red is itself a finding.** Swapping a component's `null` for an
  empty count changed no pixel — a downstream guard already suppressed both — which proved a comment
  claiming that `null` prevented the rendered zero was FALSE. The check earns its keep by failing;
  when it does not, the question is not "try a bigger mutation" but "what did I believe that is not
  true". Two other guards in the same epic passed against their own defect for the same class of
  reason: a colour parser that understood `rgb()` but not `color(srgb …)` (silently measuring an
  ancestor's background and reporting plausible PASSING numbers), and a canonical-URL assertion that
  could not fail locally because the harness builds with `SITE_URL` set.
  *(2026-08-20, methodology-experience.)*
- **When a review finds a bug, fix the CLASS or you will be told about it once per instance.** The
  maker-ops epic was told three separate times that a gated capability was listed without its
  qualification — the Ops panel, then SecOps on the hero's bag, then DevOps on the same bag. Each
  was one root cause: a hand-written list running parallel to the data. A third badge would have
  been a third patch; deriving the list made the class unrepresentable. The same shape appeared
  again with dead in-page anchors — a fix in `Nav` that left its twin in `lib/primary-cta.ts`, found
  by BOTH families in the next round. **Before claiming a fix, grep for the sibling.**
  *(2026-08-19, landing-maker-ops.)* **And writing the explanation of a class does not immunise you
  against committing an instance of it an hour later:** `landing-readability-pass`'s headline CSS fix
  was a rule sitting above its target at equal specificity and therefore inert (`.pricing__intro`) —
  and a reviewer then found the same defect, in the same file, in the code that PR had just added
  (the hero's overlap block above the base rule it overrides). *(2026-08-20,
  landing-readability-pass.)*
  **The class this time was a hand-kept COPY list** (board-sinks-and-scrumban, 2026-10-02): two spec fixtures listed
  which libs to copy into a temp repo and broke twice as the extractor grew; copying the extractor's whole closure
  ended it. Same epic, same shape: prettier formats `scripts/` but not the byte-identical `skills/` mirror, so every
  format run broke parity until the mirror was re-copied from the formatted tree as one step.
  **And twice more in live-build-view (2026-10-03):** `format:changed -- --write` reformats MODIFIED files too (the
  gate checks only ADDED ones), which broke byte-parity of three shared scripts — format the added files, then mirror;
  and a spec that read this repo's own `Roadmap/` passed here and failed in the skills mirror CI runs (`skills/` alone).
  "Every skills-ci step green locally" means nothing until it was run from a copy of `skills/`.
- **A reviewer that could not see the risky file has not reviewed it — and the tooling says so in
  its own output.** `cross-review.mjs` prints "N did not fit the budget" when a diff exceeds agy's
  256 KB argv cap. In `landing-readability-pass` the withheld file was `globals.css`, where every bit
  of the diff's non-obvious reasoning lived, and BOTH families returned clean on the unscoped rounds.
  Every real finding in that epic — one Blocking, three Should-fix — came from a later round run with
  `--paths globals.css`. **Read the attachment line before believing a clean round, and re-run scoped
  at whatever it withheld.** *(2026-08-20, landing-readability-pass.)*
- **A comment documenting an invariant is a claim, and it earns the same proof as the code.** A hero
  rule paired `align-self: end` with a fixed `margin-top`, under a comment promising the offset held
  "whatever either one's content does". True only while one object was the taller — the reviewer
  found the other case. The fix made the property real (`align-self: start`) rather than softening
  the sentence, and it was confirmed by forcing the other object +200/+400/+800px and watching the
  offset not move. **When a reviewer disputes a documented property, prove it by making the disputed
  case happen — do not rewrite the comment to cover it.** *(2026-08-20, landing-readability-pass.)*
- **Deleting a component leaves a trail in the stylesheet, and the trail comes with confident prose
  attached.** Removing an element left an orphaned `@media` rule ~200 lines away, hiding something
  that no longer rendered, under a comment explaining in detail why it was needed. Dead CSS under a
  good explanation is worse than dead CSS: it reads as evidence. **After deleting markup, sweep every
  class it used across the stylesheet — not just the rule the reviewer happened to name.**
  *(2026-08-20, landing-readability-pass.)*
- **Verify a visual claim by RENDERING, not by grepping for the class that usually causes it.**
  "Remove all the green text" was verified by sweeping computed styles — colour and border, every
  element on the page — instead of searching for `tag-live`. That is what surfaced two trend readings
  painted `--green` by a rule with no green in its name, which a class-name search would have missed
  entirely (and which were correctly recoloured rather than deleted: they are real measurements).
  *(2026-08-20, landing-readability-pass.)*
- **A test suite outside the blocking gate is a suite you must run ON PURPOSE, and a
  deletion-heavy epic will silently invalidate it.** `browser` and `authed` are not in this repo's
  gate. A guard broken in review round 1 (`toMatch(/^#/)` against nav links that had just become
  root-relative) survived two more rounds because nothing ran it; running the suite then surfaced
  FIVE stale specs, all asserting sections the epic had retired. Neither CI, the pre-push hook, nor
  a reviewer reading the diff can catch this. *(2026-08-19, landing-maker-ops.)*
- **Compute the sentence, not just the badge.** A status chip correctly derived from a flag, sitting
  beside prose that hardcodes the same claim, is the rule half-applied — and the prose is the half
  a reader actually reads. A drill note read "running a drill is switched off" whenever either of
  two independent gates was closed; true that day, false the moment one opened alone.
  *(2026-08-19, landing-maker-ops.)*
- **A repositioning drops qualifiers along with the sections that carried them.** Retiring the
  landing's §4 removed the only `isConnectorWritesEnabled()` read on the page, while the new
  section inherited the argument that flag qualified. Nothing failed — the claim simply became
  unchecked. When deleting a section, grep it for flag reads before deleting it, and re-home each
  one. *(2026-08-19, landing-maker-ops.)*
- **An advisory COPY reviewer's findings and its fixes are worth very different amounts.** Two
  foreign families reviewed the landing's prose; every issue both found independently was real, and
  findings from one alone were roughly half taste. But not one suggested replacement line was
  usable: they invented a capability ("caps spend per Bet" — in the section whose whole point is
  that nothing is built), reached for vocabulary the brand bans, or swapped a cliché for a shorter
  cliché. **Take the diagnosis; write the line yourself.** *(2026-08-19, landing-maker-ops.)*
- **A scripted CSS/text prune can leave VALID output that is semantically wrong.** Deleting a rule
  by brace-matching ate one rule's body and spliced its selectors onto the next rule — still valid
  CSS, silently dropping a style and applying another to a pseudo-element that cannot use it. A
  static "unreferenced class" sweep is also not evidence: `.chat-row--agent` and `.lift--up` are
  built as template literals and would have been purged as dead. **After a scripted prune, diff
  every rule body before/after and render the page.** *(2026-08-19, landing-maker-ops.)*
- **A fail-closed evidence context must not be reused by the safety control that stops already-running
  work.** Scenario launch and retry correctly refuse an absent or malformed immutable fault summary,
  but reusing that disclosure-heavy context for `stop` briefly made a legacy running row impossible
  to stop. Separate *eligibility to begin* from *authority to end*: the shutdown path should require
  only project-scoped identity, current lifecycle state, and the policy needed to make the transition.
  Pin the malformed/legacy row as a regression, because happy-path fixtures will always carry the new
  metadata. *(2026-08-13, scenarios-pm-operable.)*
- **A finding's CONCLUSION can be wrong while its OBSERVATION is right — check before accepting AND
  before dismissing.** Three times in one epic: "reduced motion is broken" (false — the token file
  already handled it) exposed that the new motion rule was *dead for `.btn` all along*, losing to a
  token-file selector on specificity; "the canonical-domain change is missing" (false — it was live,
  set out-of-band deliberately, since rollout order requires the env var before the deploy that
  snapshots it) correctly noted the diff alone cannot show it; and a Unicode range given as
  U+2780–2793 was wrong while the gap it named was real (❶ lives at U+2776). The reflex to dismiss on
  the first factual error would have lost all three. **Verify the claim by rendering or probing, then
  answer the observation rather than the conclusion.** *(2026-08-13, landing-frijoles-rebrand.)*
- **A reviewer repeating a finding you reasoned your way out of is a signal to find a third option.**
  Trailing `//` comments were raised twice by the same family. The first triage — that stripping them
  naively eats every `https://`, turning a loud false positive into a quiet false negative — was a
  right concern and a wrong conclusion: the risk was avoidable with a lookbehind, not inherent. A
  well-argued triage still resolves to "no change", and the second raise is the prompt to re-examine
  the premise instead of restating the trade-off. *(2026-08-13, landing-frijoles-rebrand.)*
- **Your GUARDS deserve the same suspicion as your code — three shipped in one epic that could not
  fail.** A reduced-motion spec whose predicate was `hasDuration && animationName !== 'none'`, so the
  transition half could never fire (every element with a transition and no animation reports
  `'none'`). A selection spec bounding a rect at `<= 390` on a 390px viewport, which the broken
  rendering satisfies too. And `check-design-drift.mjs`, which stripped block comments to the empty
  string and so had been reporting **the wrong line number for every violation of its entire
  existence**. A guard that looks like coverage and is not is worse than no guard, because the next
  reader stops there. Mutation-check a guard the way you would a test — break the thing it defends
  and watch it go red. *(2026-08-13, landing-frijoles-rebrand.)*
- **Half a fix reads exactly like a whole one, and can be worse than none.** Making illustrated
  buttons `aria-hidden` spans removed their SEMANTICS and left their AFFORDANCE — `cursor: pointer`
  and the hover state layer — so mouse users were invited to click what screen-reader users could no
  longer find. Strictly worse than before. Same shape as correcting a flag-honesty claim in a
  section's lead paragraph and leaving the identical claim in its card copy one level down. LEARNINGS'
  "grep for its siblings" rule applies to COPY and to ACCESSIBILITY, not only to code.
  *(2026-08-13, landing-frijoles-rebrand.)*
- **Two families beat one family run twice — with a worked example.** Codex ran nine rounds on one PR
  and never noticed the drift guard was naming the wrong line; agy found it in a single pass. Codex
  found the flag-honesty and accessibility defects agy did not. The router's insistence on different
  families is doing real work, not ceremony — and "a clean round from one family is not a stopping
  condition" is the rule that keeps it doing it. *(2026-08-13, landing-frijoles-rebrand.)*
- **A reviewer that read NOTHING still reports "clean" — read the scope line before the findings.**
  An agy round came back with no Blocking and no Should-fix, and its own output said
  `Attached 0 whole file(s); 38 did not fit the budget`: it had seen the unified diff and not one
  file. Accepting that verdict would have ended review three rounds and six real findings early,
  including a `+133%`-on-a-flat-series arithmetic bug on a public page. Rerunning with `--code-only`
  attached files and immediately produced Blocking findings. This generalises past agy: **the
  reviewer's coverage is reported next to its verdict, not inside it**, and a clean verdict from a
  reviewer with degraded input is not evidence. Same family as "a run that exits 0 with empty output
  reads as a clean review" — the failure has just moved from empty output to *confident* output over
  empty input. *(2026-08-12, landing-redesign-v2.)*
- **On concurrency work, most late review findings are bugs in your OWN previous round's fix.**
  event-destination-router S2 took 24 cross-review rounds (Codex; Antigravity went clean at 11), and
  from about round 12 the pattern was consistent: each round's blocking finding was a race introduced
  by the previous round's fix — drain-vs-in-flight, then check-then-act on liveness, then an unlocked
  join, then a batched release that skipped the lock. Iterating *fast* on lock/settle logic
  manufactures new races as quickly as it closes old ones. When a fix touches ordering, locking or
  settlement, slow down and reason about the whole state machine before shipping the next round —
  and expect the reviewer to be right about the thing you just wrote.
- **`UPDATE … FROM other_table` does NOT lock the joined rows.** A liveness/eligibility check written
  as a join reads a snapshot and gives you nothing under READ COMMITTED. If a concurrent writer can
  invalidate what you joined on, take an explicit `SELECT … FOR SHARE` as its **own statement** first
  (the next statement then runs on a fresh snapshot). Pick one lock ORDER for the whole subsystem —
  here every path locks the destination, then the delivery — so the paths can't deadlock.
- **A `CHECK` constraint that evaluates to NULL is a suggestion — PostgreSQL accepts the row.** Only
  an explicit FALSE rejects. `CHECK ((scope='share' AND share_lens IN (...)) OR (scope='ingest' AND
  share_lens IS NULL))` looks airtight and permits exactly the row it appears to forbid: for
  `scope='share', share_lens=NULL` the first arm is `TRUE AND NULL` = NULL, the second is FALSE, and
  `NULL OR FALSE` = NULL. Both the INSERT and an `UPDATE … SET scope='share'` on an existing row
  succeeded. **Wrap any composite predicate in `IS TRUE`** (and add the column-level check as a
  second, independent statement, so a later rewrite of the composite cannot silently reopen it).
  Two further rules from the same incident: the migration's COMMENT asserted the invariant held, and
  four review rounds believed it — **verify a database-level guarantee by ATTEMPTING the write you
  claim is impossible**, against the real database, before writing the comment. And check the UPDATE
  path, not just the INSERT: nothing else prevents flipping a discriminator column.
  *(2026-07-26, pod-report S3.)*
- **An audit label that can be chosen by picking an endpoint is worse than no audit log.** A
  share-link revoke action called the generic `revokeApiKey`, so a request carrying an INGEST key's id
  revoked that key while the trail recorded `report_share_revoked`. The privilege boundary held — an
  owner may revoke their own keys — but an incident responder searching `api_key_revoked` for "why did
  ingest stop?" would find nothing. **When two operations share a table, the mutation needs the
  discriminator in its WHERE clause, or the endpoint decides what the record says.**
  *(2026-07-26, pod-report S3.)*
- **`DROP FUNCTION` + `CREATE` silently restores Postgres' PUBLIC EXECUTE default.** Changing a
  function's return type forces a drop, which discards the earlier migration's REVOKEs — so a
  service-role-only function quietly became anon-callable. Any migration that re-creates a function
  must re-REVOKE from `PUBLIC, anon, authenticated` and re-GRANT `service_role`. Pin it with a spec
  that asserts a **function-level** denial (42501 mentioning "function", or PostgREST's PGRST202) and
  explicitly NOT an RLS error — an RLS failure would mean EXECUTE leaked and the body actually ran.
- **A comment cannot amend an architecture rule.** When a reviewer flags a documented invariant
  (AGENTS' "no read path can cross projects") and the honest answer is "this scheduler genuinely
  needs to be cross-tenant", the move is NOT to write a persuasive in-code rationale and proceed. It
  is to bound the exposure (return only opaque ids, service-role only, single-tenant downstream) and
  put the rule change in front of the human as an explicit either/or decision. Cross-review rejected
  the self-exemption twice, correctly.
- **A manual smoke test (or a spec) written by the same session that built the feature can share the
  implementation's own narrow, unstated assumption — and miss the exact bug a differently-shaped
  check would catch.** growth-engine-v1 S4's A/B comparison query originally required the *metric/
  conversion* event to also carry `featureId` set to the experiment key, mirroring how the
  *exposure* event is scoped. Every spec written during the build, and the builder's own manual
  `curl` smoke, happened to tag the conversion event with `featureId` too — so both looked green. A
  real conversion event (`checkout_completed`, `signup`, ...) fired through the normal track() path
  has no reason to carry an unrelated experiment's key; the bug would have silently reported 0
  conversions for every real caller. Only a **fresh reviewer with no context on how the feature was
  built** — reviewing the diff and its acceptance criteria cold — thought to ask "what does a
  *realistic*, untagged input actually look like?" When writing the acceptance check for a new
  feature, deliberately try the least-convenient/most-realistic input shape, not just the one that
  happens to match how you already wired the implementation — and don't skip the fresh-reviewer pass
  even when your own gate is green and your own manual smoke looked fine. *(2026-07-16,
  growth-engine-v1 S4.)*
  **This bug class has now recurred THREE times in this repo, and the third instance was already
  LIVE IN PRODUCTION, undetected.** `lib/tars-query.ts` filters events by `feature_id`, so an event
  written without a `featureId` tag belongs to no funnel and is invisible forever. `trackSelfEvent`
  never set one — meaning the landing dogfood funnel `commercial-shell` S3 shipped had been reading
  **zero since launch** while ingesting events perfectly (confirmed against prod: all four
  `landing_visited` rows had `feature_id = NULL`). Nothing errored, nothing alerted. **The
  generalizable rule: a query that silently REQUIRES a tag the realistic caller has no reason to set
  fails as an honest-looking zero, and a zero pages nobody.** When you add a read path that filters
  on an optional column, the very next thing to check is whether the WRITE path actually sets it —
  and any dashboard whose "correct" empty state is indistinguishable from its broken state needs one
  end-to-end check that produces a NON-zero number. *(2026-07-21, multi-tenant-activation S2/S3.)*
  **FOURTH instance — and the first one the SYSTEM caught instead of a human.** The
  experiment-governance-v2 Miyagi dogfood registered a plan whose `eligibility.tags` declared
  `{campaign: "vende_fundadoras"}`; `tagsMatch` requires every declared eligibility tag to be present
  on the exposure, and the emitter had no reason to send a `campaign` tag. All 24 production exposures
  were rejected. The difference from the previous three: the governed report did **not** show a
  plausible zero — it returned `decisionReady: false`, `blockers: ["srm_not_evaluable",
  "eligibility_mismatch"]` and `integrity: [{code: "eligibility_mismatch", count: 24, severity:
  "blocker"}]`, naming the cause and the count. **A declared predicate is a JOIN CONDITION, not
  documentation** — anything you assert in a plan (eligibility tags, a metric name, an entity type)
  must be something the real emitter actually sends, and the cheapest way to find out is one live
  event read back through the real analysis path before you trust the plan. *(2026-07-28,
  experiment-governance-v2 S3.3.)*

  **FIFTH and SIXTH instances — same class, found in the SAME pull request, by review rather than by
  the gate.** app-shell-and-agent-rail's `StatCard` exists *specifically* to make an unreadable
  figure unrepresentable, and its docblock said the caveat was "REQUIRED alongside a null value at
  the type level." **`ReactNode` includes `undefined`**, so `caveat: ReactNode` accepted
  `caveat={undefined}` and rendered an empty `<span>` — a number-shaped nothing, in the component
  whose entire subject is that distinction. `NonNullable<ReactNode>` fixed it and failed the build
  immediately at the one call site that could reach the hole. Separately, the agent rail's summary
  chip was `pending?.length ?? 0` rendered only when `> 0`, so a FAILED read produced the same
  silent chip as an empty one.

  **Two rules generalise, and the second is new:** (1) a type that *reads* as if it forbids a state
  may not actually forbid it — `ReactNode`, `unknown`, and any union that quietly admits `undefined`
  are where "make it unrepresentable" becomes "make it look unrepresentable"; verify by attempting
  the construction you claim is impossible, the same way CODE-QUALITY rule 3 asks you to attempt the
  write. (2) **An honest empty state that is not visible in the COLLAPSED view is not an honest empty
  state.** The rail's panel is server-rendered closed and only opens on a wide viewport, so on a
  phone the chip was the only thing a reader saw — the honest sentence was there, behind a disclosure
  nobody has a reason to open. Ask where the message renders when the component is in its smallest
  state. *(2026-08-07, app-shell-and-agent-rail S2/S3.)*
- **A corrected experiment version must fix the WINDOW as well as the predicate, or the old version's
  exposures block the new one.** The first correction (v2) removed the bad eligibility predicate but
  kept v1's planned window, which still contained the 24 exposures v1 had already emitted — and
  `version_mismatch` is a **blocker** (only `duplicate_exposure` and `out_of_window_exposure` are
  warnings), so v2 would have started blocked by its own predecessor's data. v3 moved
  `plannedWindow.startAt` past the last v1 exposure, which drops those rows from the SQL fact
  selection entirely instead of counting them as mismatches. **When you supersede an immutable
  definition, ask what the PREVIOUS version already wrote into the new one's window.**
  *(2026-07-28, experiment-governance-v2 S3.3.)*
- **Two different non-Claude model families, single-pass each, can replace a same-family fresh-
  reviewer subagent for ordinary PRs — not just supplement it as advisory noise.** commercial-shell
  Sprint 3 ran Codex + Agy (Antigravity) as the judgment-layer review instead of also spawning a
  same-family Claude reviewer, and they caught three real bugs a same-family read might well have
  missed anyway: a seed script silently rotating a production API key hash on a bare re-run, two
  routes inline-`await`ing a real network call (blocking the response, and in one case delaying a
  Set-Cookie behind it), and a public write route with no rate limit its siblings all had. Findings
  from this pass should be treated as real review feedback (Blocking → fix before merge), not
  background-only noise — see the updated `WAYS-OF-WORKING.md` "Review & merge" section. Still
  reserve an ADDITIONAL same-family read for HIGH-risk PRs (money/auth/DB/shared infra) — cross-
  family review is a floor for ordinary PRs, not a ceiling for the stakes that warrant more.
  **Corollary — fixing one round's findings can introduce a NEW bug a second review round then
  catches, and actually EXECUTING the fix can catch a THIRD class of bug neither review round
  found.** The same PR's round-1 fix (moving a blocking `await` to `next/server`'s `after()`)
  introduced a subtler identity race that round-2 review caught; then the actual CI run caught a
  totally different bug — a GitHub Actions workflow exporting an env var one step too late for an
  already-running background process to see it (see below) — that no amount of reading the diff,
  by any model, would have found. Static review and real execution are complementary, not
  redundant; budget for both, especially right after a "fix" to something already reviewed.
  *(2026-07-20, commercial-shell Sprint 3.)*
  **Two rounds is a FLOOR, not a ritual — on auth/DB/shared-ingest work the curve may still not be
  flat at round three.** multi-tenant-activation S2/S3 ran three: round 1 found 4 Blocking, round 2
  found 5 more (one of them a bug round 1's own fix introduced), round 3 found 3 more — including a
  quota-accounting bug that made the feature's ONLY documented remedy silently fail. Stop when a
  round comes back clean, not when you hit a round count. *(2026-07-21, multi-tenant-activation.)*
- **Cross-FAMILY review is a floor on high-risk work, and a same-family "clean" round is not a
  finish line.** pod-report S3 ran FOUR agy rounds on a new credential surface — seven Should-fix,
  zero Blocking, and round 4, aimed deliberately at the auth/tenancy surface, came back **clean**.
  Codex then opened with a **Blocking** finding on that same surface (a share route re-resolving its
  tenant from a MUTABLE `slug` instead of carrying the `project_id` its credential had already
  resolved), plus two Should-fix the other family had read past four times. Neither family is better;
  they are blind in different directions, which is the entire reason to run both. **Stop when a round
  from the OTHER family comes back clean, not when your usual reviewer does.** *(2026-07-26.)*
- **Report a finding's severity from what you can reproduce, not from what the reviewer labelled it.**
  The Blocking finding above was real and worth fixing — and it was NOT reachable the way it read.
  A spec was written to pin it (mint a token for tenant A, rename A, give A's old slug to B, assert
  the token still renders A) and it **passed against a deliberately re-broken build**: the resolving
  view re-reads the slug through a live JOIN every request, so a rename resolves correctly. The real
  exposure is a TOCTOU window inside one request, milliseconds wide, not HTTP-testable. Fix it (the
  fix was free — the caller already held the id), and then say plainly that the argument is
  construction rather than coverage. **A spec that LOOKS like a teeth test is worse than an absent
  one, because the next reader stops there** — mutation-check the ones you are proudest of.
  *(2026-07-26, pod-report S3.)*
- **Route external review by risk and demonstrated strength; two full reads are not a tax on every
  diff.** The 2026-07-23 Entity/Experiment trial established the current rail: Agy is the fast
  baseline architectural/security read; Devin's default router earns the second seat for high-risk
  migrations, tenancy and concurrency; Cursor Auto is slower/quota-limited but caught two real S1
  boundary defects (audit-cascade SQL and Unicode whitespace), so it remains a specialist/tie-breaker
  when quota permits. OpenAI/Codex stays in the builder/architect role, not review. The efficient
  high-risk sequence is Agy early → fix/rerun to clean → Devin once on the stabilized exact head;
  rerun the finder after a substantive fix, and rerun the other tool only if the fix crosses the
  boundary it reviewed. Do targeted validation rather than two fresh full reads for wording/
  presentation-only deltas. Different tools are coverage, not a ceremonial pass count.
- **A model catalog is not an entitlement list, and free-tier Devin needs strict triage.**
  `devin models list` advertised named Claude tiers that returned `/upgrade` when invoked; the free
  default router did run headlessly, but on Experiment Governance S2 it ignored an explicit
  `origin/main...HEAD` boundary and promoted seven already-shipped or intentional facts as findings.
  Keep its read-only prompt explicit, verify every cited line against the actual diff, and record false
  positives rather than converting them into churn. This still earns a high-risk second seat because it
  is a cheap independent repository scout; it does not replace Agy's cleaner diff discipline.
- **A fire-and-forget notifier that never fails the build also never tells you it is broken — and a
  green workflow is NOT evidence a message arrived.** `notify-telegram.yml` shipped with
  `curl … || true` (correct: a Telegram outage must not fail a deploy) and every single ping it ever
  sent was REJECTED by Telegram with `400 can't parse entities`. The workflow reported success for
  its entire life, and the agent that built it reported it "verified live in production" — having
  checked that the job ran and exited 0, which is not the same question as whether the message was
  delivered. Discovered only because Daniel noticed he had stopped receiving notifications.
  **Two rules. (1) For any fire-and-forget side effect, INSPECT THE RESPONSE and surface a failure
  as a warning annotation — keep `|| true` so the build never breaks, but never let "the job
  succeeded" and "the thing happened" be the same signal. (2) Verify a notification by looking in
  the CHANNEL, not at the exit code; if you cannot see the channel, say that the delivery is
  unverified rather than calling it verified.**
  The payload bug itself is worth knowing too: `jq -n '…'` emits JSON, so a *quoted* string with
  `\"` escapes. Building `TEXT` in one `jq` and passing it to a second as `--arg text "$TEXT"`
  double-encodes it, and the recipient sees literal `<a href=\"…\">`. Build the whole payload in a
  SINGLE jq pass so the double-encoding is unrepresentable rather than merely fixed.
  **Sharpened 2026-07-26 — the right fix is an EXIT CODE, not an annotation, and it depends on where
  the notifier lives.** The `|| true` + `::warning` arrangement was inherited from a design where the
  ping was a step inside a deploy job, where failing it would fail a deploy. In a repo where the
  notifier is its OWN workflow triggered by `push`/`deployment_status`, it is an observer: it cannot
  fail a deploy and cannot block a PR (neither trigger is a `pull_request` event), so a rejected
  message SHOULD turn the run red. A green check plus an annotation nobody reads is not monitoring.
  Also: two implementations of the same escaping/length rule is one too many — a jq copy of an
  already-tested `escapeToFit` was written and its FIRST test proved it wrong in exactly the way the
  original's comment predicted (it capped the RAW subject; 3,500 `>` characters escape to 14,129).
  Share the tested function instead of porting it. And measure the real payloads before believing a
  length theory: the live pings are 232 and 261 characters against a 4,096 limit.
  *(2026-07-26, pod-report/quality-rails.)*
- **A multi-channel observer needs independent delivery steps and one upstream resolution step.**
  Exporting deploy metadata to `$GITHUB_ENV` at the *end* of the first channel’s send step looks
  shared, but Actions stops that shell as soon as the notifier exits non-zero—so the export never
  happens and every later channel is skipped. Resolve the commit header/status/url first, export
  once, then let each channel send in its own step; later channels use `if: always()` so one outage
  cannot suppress the other while the observer job still finishes red. For local prose, persist the
  exact reviewed text and a per-destination success checkpoint before the first POST; otherwise a
  partial retry either duplicates the successful channel or asks the writer for different prose.
  Slack’s Incoming Webhook response is plain text (`ok` or an error token), not Telegram JSON—read
  it as text and pin both branches in tests. *(2026-07-28, notification-rails.)*
- **`String.replace` with a STRING replacement expands `$&`, `$'` and `` $` ``** — a title or acceptance criterion
  holding one is silently rewritten. Every frontmatter/markdown rewrite takes a function replacer
  (`s.replace(re, () => text)`); the spec that pinned it fell into the same trap the first time.
  *(2026-10-04, fund-at-approval review.)*
- **A scripted `str.replace()` that finds nothing SUCCEEDS SILENTLY — and the test you write alongside
  it can pass while the change never landed.** pod-report S2 added `checkSucceeded()` (accepting both
  GitHub check-run `conclusion` and classic commit-status `state`), unit-tested it, and shipped —
  except the edit wiring it into the caller silently no-op'd, because a formatter had reflowed the
  target text between writing the patch and running it. The helper existed, its tests passed, and
  the caller kept its old conclusion-only comparison for **three review rounds**. What let it hide
  was the test's shape: it exercised the helper DIRECTLY, and the one adapter case it did check
  (`state: 'FAILURE'`) returns false under both the fixed and the broken code. The distinguishing
  input — a *succeeding* classic status — was never tried. **Two rules: (1) assert that a scripted
  edit matched (`assert old in s`) — an unasserted replace is a no-op waiting to happen, and it is
  invisible in a green test run; (2) when you extract a helper, test it THROUGH its caller with an
  input whose result DIFFERS between the old and new implementations, or you have tested the helper
  and not the integration.** *(2026-07-25, pod-report S2.)*
- **A spec that watches a mechanism RUNNING will not notice it never puts anything back.** The
  `ConfirmDialog` focus-trap spec asserted the tab cycle never escaped the dialog, ran green, and
  passed a component that stranded keyboard users on `<body>` the moment it closed — it unmounted
  itself instead of calling native `close()`, so the browser never performed focus restoration.
  Cross-review found it; CI could not, and neither could the spec, because it only ever examined
  focus **while the dialog was open**. Whenever you spec a thing that opens/acquires/locks, spec the
  close/release/unlock as a separate assertion — coverage of the happy path is not coverage of the
  exit. *(2026-08-09, app-component-kit-adoption S1.)*
- **A cross-family finding is a SAMPLE, not the population — grep for the class before calling it
  fixed.** Agy reported a missing `try/catch` on two managers; the same shape was in a third from an
  earlier sprint, and searching for the *class* turned up a fourth variant no reviewer flagged — one
  that had already been fixed once, two PRs earlier, and reintroduced one file over. Both times this
  epic, the reported file was one instance of a pattern. Fix the pattern, then say in the reply how
  much wider you applied it. *(2026-08-09, app-component-kit-adoption S3.)*
- **A spec can be unreachable-by-construction and still pass — the mutation check is what proves a
  spec has teeth, and it must mutate the EXACT line the spec claims to defend.** multi-tenant-activation
  S1 fixed a real open redirect in an auth callback (cross-review caught `/\evil.example`: it defeats a
  `startsWith('/') && !startsWith('//')` check because `new URL()` normalizes the backslash into `//`)
  and added four HTTP-level specs asserting the callback never redirects off-origin. All four passed —
  **and passed identically against a deliberately re-broken build.** The route only consults `next`
  *after* a successful auth-code exchange, so an unauthenticated request never reached the branch at
  all; the specs were asserting the fallback path in both directions. Neither review round would ever
  have caught this: the specs *look* correct, and CI was green. **The generalizable rules:** (1) run
  the mutation check on every security-critical spec, not just when a test was written after the code —
  "the spec passes" and "the spec can fail" are different facts; (2) when a guard sits behind an
  auth/state precondition your test harness can't satisfy, an HTTP-level spec is structurally incapable
  of reaching it — extract the guard into a **pure, zero-import module** and assert it directly (the
  `lib/flags.ts` precedent already in this repo), rather than assuming end-to-end coverage implies
  branch coverage. *(2026-07-20, multi-tenant-activation S1.)*
  **Two more shapes of the same trap (workspaces, 2026-10-01):** (a) *"it is gone from the list" against a list of one*.
  The switcher renders a label, not a link, when there's one project, so `a[href*=slug]` count 0 held either way. Give
  the fixture two items, assert presence first, and assert a positive on the state you expect afterwards. (b) *An authed
  spec that adds rows to the SHARED signed-in fixture user* changes what every parallel spec sees (`/app` renders that
  user's first project). Sign in a disposable person per spec instead, in a context with EMPTY `storageState`: in the
  authed project a new context inherits the shared session, and `/login` silently bounces to `/app` as that user.

  **A spec can also defend exactly HALF of the rule it is named after, and look complete.**
  app-shell-and-agent-rail's `e2e/agent-activity.spec.ts` claimed to cover the decision "the
  allow-list is applied in the QUERY, never `select *`". Deleting `.in('action', …)` from the query
  left every test green — because the module also re-applies the allow-list in JS, so the returned
  ROWS stayed correct and only the `limit` was wrong. The hidden failure is concrete: a destination
  outage writes one excluded row per undelivered event, a page of those consumes the limit, and the
  rail renders "nothing recorded recently" while real activity sits one row below the cut. **When a
  rule is enforced in two places for two different reasons — correctness AND efficiency — a spec that
  only observes the output tests the second-to-last layer. Ask which mutation would go undetected,
  not whether the assertions pass.** That question came from a fresh reviewer, not from the gate.
  *(2026-08-07, app-shell-and-agent-rail S1.)*
- **When a migration changes what the CODE READS, the rollout has a mandatory order: env vars →
  migration → merge/deploy. Getting it backwards is an outage, not a hiccup.** multi-tenant-activation
  S1 switched `lib/auth.ts` from `projects.api_key_hash` to a new `api_keys` table; deploying that code
  before the migration would have 500'd *every* ingest call for *every* tenant. Two ordering rules,
  both easy to get wrong: (1) **`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars are build-time inlined**, so they must exist
  *before* the merge triggers the build — setting them after means a deployed bundle with `undefined`
  baked in, and no redeploy is triggered by an env change alone; (2) **the expand migration must land
  before the code that reads it** (expand/contract exists precisely so both orders of *rollback* are
  safe, but rollout is still strictly ordered). Verify afterward with a check that distinguishes the
  two failure modes: an invalid credential returning **401 rather than 500** proves the new table
  exists and resolves, and driving one real end-to-end call with a *pre-existing* credential proves the
  backfill preserved live access.
  **Re-run successfully at the multi-tenant-activation launch (2026-07-21), with one addition worth
  copying: drive that "real credential" check through a route the APP already authenticates for**
  (here `/api/v1/public/self-visit`, which uses the production key server-side) — you get the same
  proof without a production secret ever entering a shell, which also sidesteps the auto-mode
  classifier entirely. Same trick applies to admin seeding: registering a feature row via
  `supabase db query --linked` beat re-running a seed script that would have needed the tenant's
  plaintext key. Also: `supabase db push` does **not** apply `seed.sql` unless you
  pass `--include-seed` — worth confirming, since a test-fixture seed reaching prod would be its own
  incident. *(2026-07-21, multi-tenant-activation S1.)*
  **The CONTRACT step has the mirror-image rule: `SET NOT NULL` lands only after the code that WRITES the column has
  deployed.** workspaces moved NOT NULL out of the sprint that added the column (2026-10-01): signup was live, and the
  provisioning code then in production inserted projects without a workspace. So: expand → backfill → merge the writer →
  re-backfill stragglers + NOT NULL → merge the readers. Every PR still has its migration applied before its own merge.
- **A role column in the schema is not an access rule — grep for who actually reads it.**
  multi-tenant-activation S1 shipped `project_members.role` with an `owner`/`member` CHECK constraint
  and a membership gate that only ever asked "is this user a member?" — so any member could mint a
  full ingest credential or revoke the key production runs on. Every test was green (they asserted
  member-vs-non-member, the boundary that *was* implemented), and round-1 review missed it too; only a
  second review round asked "what is `role` for?" **When a table carries a privilege column, one gate
  per privilege LEVEL is the minimum — and the least-privilege split (read vs. credential-admin) is
  worth designing at the same time as the column, not after.** *(2026-07-20, multi-tenant-activation S1.)*
- **A new boundary check at an auth seam needs a structural guarantee for every grant path, or it quietly REMOVES
  access.** workspaces added "the project's workspace must be one of yours" to the membership seam (2026-10-01). Under
  the old rule a `project_members` row was enough, so any grant that didn't also add a workspace membership (every spec
  fixture, any future invite flow) would have become a silent 404. The fix was structural, not procedural: a trigger
  places every future project member inside the workspace, and a catch-up insert covers existing rows. Don't rely on
  "prod measured 0 today". **When you narrow who passes a seam, enumerate who writes the thing the seam reads.**
- **When you harden one instance of a class of bug, immediately grep for its siblings — a fix applied
  in only one of two places is a *latent inconsistency* a later reviewer will find.** Round 1 hardened
  both seed scripts against a cross-project credential bind; the identical `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` in
  the *migration* that does the same backfill was left untouched, and round 2 flagged it as Blocking.
  The fix is cheap at the time you're already in the mental model; it's a whole extra review cycle
  later. *(2026-07-20, multi-tenant-activation S1.)*
  **A lock's "nothing reads X" is the same grep, across every package:** first-run-setup's D4 said nothing reads
  `project.startPoint` after grepping skills/ and scripts/; `packages/cli` reads it through the kit's registry.
  *(2026-10-07)*
  **Run a generator on someone else's real repo before review.** Fixtures written by the code's author share its
  blind spots: a clone of `sindresorhus/ky` found a dev-only test server reported as the stack and a header linking a
  seed that never existed, both past every fixture. *(2026-10-07, first-run-setup.)*
  **A redirect on a front door is the same shape:** before changing what a URL does, grep every link TO it.
  portfolio-view made bare `/app` open the portfolio; the lock caught the switcher's `?project=` links, and the build
  found three more (the Today tab, two crumbs, and the switcher's fallback — the last one only by the fresh reviewer).
  *(2026-10-03.)*
  **The same holds for a rule's wording:** a seed that lists "the N places this rule lives" gives you a
  starting grep, not the scope. session-budget's seed listed four; the grep found nine, because shared
  templates hold byte-identical copies (three `WAYS-OF-WORKING.template.md` files and the template's own
  LEARNINGS). *(2026-09-30, session-budget.)*
  **And for a new SOURCE of a thing:** adding a second place state ids come from (approved `surface` files beside the
  prototype) meant widening every place that validates membership in the set. The contract generator was widened; the
  route manifest's "is this an approved id?" test was not, so an approved surface could never have reached the gate —
  the epic's headline claim, false under a green CI. `git grep` the constant that enumerates the set
  (`ALL_STATE_IDS`) and read every hit. The same epic fixed `kind in OBJ` → `Object.hasOwn` in one PR and left the
  identical `state in entries` in the next. *(2026-09-30, sketch-specs; both found by the fresh reviewer.)*
- **`onConflict` + `ignoreDuplicates` on a GLOBALLY-unique credential column is a silent cross-tenant
  bind, not idempotency.** Two seed scripts upserted an `api_keys` row with `{ onConflict: 'key_hash',
  ignoreDuplicates: true }` to be "safely re-runnable." Because `key_hash` is unique *across all
  projects*, a hash already owned by a DIFFERENT project makes the upsert report success while writing
  nothing — and the script then hands back the plaintext key as if it provisioned it, so that key
  authenticates as the OTHER tenant. Caught by cross-review, invisible to every green test. **When a
  unique column is a credential, "insert or ignore" must become "look first, then verify the existing
  row belongs to the intended owner and is still active, else fail loud"** — silence on conflict is
  only safe when the conflicting row can't belong to someone else. *(2026-07-20, multi-tenant-activation S1.)*

- **A comment asserting a check the code does not actually perform is worse than no comment, and it
  survives review rounds.** A round-1 fix claimed in prose to distinguish two unique constraints by
  name; the code just re-read a membership table that is empty during precisely the window the race
  opens, so the "fix" could strand a user harder than the bug had. Round 2 caught it by reading the
  code against its own comment. **Prose in a diff reads as evidence** — a reviewer who sees a stated
  rationale spends their scrutiny elsewhere. When you write "we check X here", re-read the lines
  underneath and confirm they check X. *(2026-07-21, multi-tenant-activation S2.)*
- **A narrower `GRANT` revokes nothing — on Supabase, new public-schema tables arrive with
  `service_role` already granted ALL.** A migration granted `SELECT, INSERT` and a comment claimed
  the table was therefore append-only; it was purely additive and the claim was false. Only an
  explicit `REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE` made it true. **Caught because a spec ATTEMPTED the mutation with
  the app's own client** rather than trusting the grant statement to mean what it looks like — the
  same "assert the property, don't assert the code that's supposed to produce it" discipline as the
  mutation check. *(2026-07-21, multi-tenant-activation S2.)*
- **A "just raise the limit" remedy must be tested after SUSTAINED abuse, not one rejection.** A
  monthly quota counter incremented BEFORE comparing against the ceiling (necessary — that's what
  makes it atomic), but rejected calls were never refunded, so a retrying client drove the count
  arbitrarily far past the ceiling and raising it then failed to restore service. The existing spec
  raised the ceiling after exactly ONE rejection, which the bug survived. **Whenever the documented
  recovery procedure for a limit is "change the limit", write the spec that abuses it first.**
  *(2026-07-21, multi-tenant-activation S2.)*
- **A write-side resource cap only guarantees readability if it measures the SAME bytes the read-side
  bound sums — aligning the number is not aligning the measurement.** experiment-governance-v2 S3's
  append-only decision ledger capped cumulative writes on `analysis_snapshot` bytes only, while the
  read resolver's bound summed `rationale + analysis + integrity` per row. Because the read total is
  always strictly greater, a history of long/multi-byte rationales (well within the supported 100
  records) could be *accepted on write yet permanently unreadable* on read (`resource_limit`) — and an
  append-only immutable ledger can never be shrunk, so it bricks the whole governed view (UI/API/MCP)
  forever. An earlier fix that only lowered the write number (8→4 MiB) looked right and was still
  wrong; the real fix makes the write path count the exact same fields (`jsonb_build_object` of all
  three) so write-accept ⟹ read-accept by construction. **When two layers both bound the same data,
  make them measure the same thing, and prove it with a teeth test that fills to the write cap then
  round-trips the max-accepted payload through the real read path** — mutation-verify it fails against
  the single-field cap. Green tests with small payloads never exercise this; a fresh cold reviewer
  found it after typecheck+build+307-passing-api+dark all passed. *(2026-07-23, experiment-governance-v2 S3.)*
- **Fixing a review finding by adding a MODE is a smell; fixing it by MOVING the code is usually
  right.** A retry path placed in a Server Component couldn't set cookies, which forced a
  "provision without handing over a key" mode, which then silently skipped a starter-feature
  registration too — one constraint metastasising into three defects across two review rounds.
  Moving the retry into a Route Handler (which can set cookies) deleted the mode and all of its
  consequences at once. When a fix needs a flag/mode to accommodate where it lives, question the
  location before adding the flag. *(2026-07-21, multi-tenant-activation S2.)* **When the modes are the feature**
  (fund · re-bet · reorder), write the input matrix before the code: four review rounds of fund-at-approval were one
  mode decision re-found case by case, until a 25-case {doc shape × funded × placed × flag} matrix closed it.
  *(2026-10-04, fund-at-approval.)*
- **A tool that writes what a board reads must read it the way the board reads it.** `fund.mjs` read
  `build_order`/`underwritten_by`/`appetite` from the seed while the extractor read the epic README first, so a
  hand-made README/seed split could be funded twice. Import or mirror the reader's precedence, and spec the mixed
  state. *(2026-10-04, fund-at-approval.)*

- **An enablement flag flipped at launch is only half a launch — verify by exercising the surface,
  and expect to need a deploy.** The multi-tenant-activation flip looked done (`vercel env add`
  reported success, `vercel env ls` showed the var) and was not: `/signup` kept 404ing for 7+
  minutes. Vercel snapshots env vars into a deployment at BUILD time, so already-running functions
  serve what they captured. A commit to `main` is what makes it live. Budget a deploy into any
  "just flip the flag" step, and never treat a CLI listing as evidence the flag is in effect.
  *(2026-07-21, multi-tenant-activation Story 3.3.)*

- **A `font:` SHORTHAND resets family, weight and style, so an override that restates only
  `font-size` leaves the rest of it in place — and it looks applied.** `tokens.css` sets
  `.tag { font: 600 10px var(--mono); letter-spacing: .08em }` for the landing; the console's own
  `.tag` restated `font-size` and every type/risk chip rendered as tracked-out mono anyway. The same
  trap on `.note` (italic mono) one rule over. **When you override a rule written as a shorthand,
  override its FIELDS.** Found by putting the built page beside the prototype, not by reading the
  diff. *(2026-08-28, console-ia-overhaul S3.)*
- **A universal `* { margin: 0 }` reset defeats the UA's `margin: auto` on `dialog:modal`, and
  nothing will tell you.** Every confirmation dialog in this product — money-path kill switches
  included — had been pinned to the viewport's TOP-LEFT corner since the component shipped, measured
  at `x: 0, y: 0` in 1440×960. No spec looks at where a dialog *is*, and no screenshot of one had
  been read. `dialog` is the one element whose UA margin means something; restate it rather than
  weakening the reset. *(2026-08-28, console-ia-overhaul S3.)*
- **A selector written against markup that later MOVED is dead CSS that reads as live CSS.** The
  command palette's keyboard cursor was painted by `li[aria-selected='true'] a`; a later fix moved
  `role="option"` and `aria-selected` onto the ANCHOR (a listbox option must not contain a separately
  focusable control) and left the rule behind. So ↑/↓ moved an announcement a screen reader could
  hear and a sighted reader could not see — the exact defect that rule's own comment claimed to
  prevent, pointing the other way. **When you move an attribute, grep the stylesheet for it.**
  *(2026-08-28, console-ia-overhaul S3.)*
- **Prove a gate-off guarantee by RENDERING both off-states, not by reading the diff — and let the
  render tell you the ONE thing that is not identical.** Story 3.3's promise ("with the gate off the
  page is byte-for-byte what it was") is a promise about TWO gates (A21), so the check is four page
  renders — this branch × the merge base × two off-states — normalised for per-run ids and diffed.
  The rendered DOM was identical both times, and the exercise surfaced the residual difference a
  `git diff` cannot show: the new client component joins the route's chunk manifest even though it
  never renders. That sentence is what keeps "byte-for-byte" honest, and this file already records
  the same claim being overstated twice. *(2026-08-28, console-ia-overhaul S3.)*
- **When a design and the control plane disagree about a WORD, the control plane wins and the
  disagreement is the finding.** The approved wizard says *"a release toggle is off by default"*,
  which maps onto `defaultVariantKey: 'off'`. In this system that creates a feature you cannot turn
  on — activation and what the served version EVALUATES to are different things, and the console's
  own `describeActivationSurprise` raises a confirm on every activation of a version that evaluates
  to `false` (the latest version of 34 of 42 live flags). Following the design literally would have
  manufactured features whose own switch warns about them, forever. Write the deviation down as an
  amendment; a design is a contract about the product, not about the storage model underneath it.
  *(2026-08-28, console-ia-overhaul S3.)*
- **A number an acceptance criterion owes is cheaper to MEASURE than to argue about.** Story 3.4 owed
  "the `/app` load cost does not regress". Counting requests in a browser gave `0 / 1 / 1` — page
  load, first `⌘K`, reopen — in one spec, which is worth more than any amount of reasoning about
  when a fetch fires. The same session measured `2889px → ≤960px`, `3346px → ≤960px`, `x:0 → x:505`
  and `~16 KB → 1.1 KB`. Every one of those started life as an adjective in a story.
  *(2026-08-28, console-ia-overhaul S3.)*
- **When you stop shipping dark, audit CI's flag env — for EVERY flag, not the one you flipped.**
  A19 caught `CONSOLE_SHELL_ENABLED` inverting three suites on merge day. Sprint 3 found its sibling:
  **`FLAG_CONSOLE_ENABLED` was set nowhere in the workflow at all**, so the entire blocking gate had
  been asserting a dark flag console against a production that served it lit — and
  `flag-console-dark.spec.ts` only ever ran its dark branch. CI matched production by accident and
  stopped when production moved. The fix is the shape already in the file: explicitly OFF on the
  differently-enved server, ON everywhere else, with the branching spec listed in both runs.
  *(2026-08-28, console-ia-overhaul S3.)*
- **Kill the server before every rebuild, or you are testing a build you did not make.** Twice in one
  session a clean restore "still failed" because a `next start` from the previous build was still
  holding :3000 and the new one silently failed to bind. It reads exactly like a regression that
  survived a revert. `lsof -tiTCP:3000 -sTCP:LISTEN | xargs -r kill` belongs in FRONT of the build,
  not after it. *(2026-08-28; the local-gate recipe already says this for stale servers, and it was
  still learned again.)*
- **A plan whose every acceptance criterion is STRUCTURAL cannot fail on a bad-looking page, and the
  build will satisfy all of them.** `console-ia-overhaul` shipped two sprints of correct information
  architecture and a visual result the product owner rejected on sight — thirteen criteria, all met.
  The plan had demoted an approved design to "inspiration" by misapplying WAYS-OF-WORKING's
  reference-end-state rule, which exists to stop a *speculative spec doc* being treated as signed-off
  scope and says nothing about a design somebody approved. **Where a design has been approved, it is
  scope: measure the contract (sizes, weights, counts, scroll height) out of the artefact with a
  script, and write the spec that fails BEFORE the work starts.** The gate that caught it was red at
  `2889px in a 960px viewport` on day one. *(2026-08-28, console-ia-overhaul A20/A22.)*

- **Fix a shared seam at EVERY caller, in the same commit.** (2026-09-25, `experiments-for-humans`
  #172.) A round fixed the roll-out to load the *named* experiment version instead of the latest; undo
  and retry called the same loader and kept the latest — a "Change the plan" draft broke both, found a
  round later. When a finding is about a shared function's contract, `git grep` its callers before
  calling it fixed.
- **Scope a fix to the finding's CAUSE, and pin it with the case the over-broad fix would fail.**
  (2026-09-25, `experiments-for-humans` #172.) Twice a fix over-corrected — a short-sample gate that
  hid *every* blocker, a guardrail harmed by one arm pinned on another — and each cost a review round.
  The regression test for the finding passes under both the right and the over-broad fix; the case
  that tells them apart is the one to write.
- **Content equality is not a safe precondition for overwriting shared state; name the version you
  replace, and let the server insist.** (2026-09-25, `experiments-for-humans`.) "Same definition once
  stripped" was right for Start and wrong for roll-out/undo, which change the feature on purpose.
  Every Production activation now reads the revision first, then requires Production to serve an
  exact version id, and re-checks on a revision conflict — and the page's "can roll out" is the same
  comparison, so a button is never drawn for a write the server will refuse.

- **Flip CI's gate the same day Production's flips — a gate left OFF in CI hides every defect behind
  it, including ones that are not the gate's.** (2026-09-26, `experiments-for-humans`, #174.) The
  builder ran dark in CI for the whole epic (the push credential lacked the `workflow` scope), so its
  authed specs skipped. The first builder-ON run in CI's exact env found a shell bug that predates the epic
  (a flex item's `min-width: auto` defeating its own ellipsis at 360px for multi-project owners) and a
  spec writing into the shared authed tenant a sibling spec asserts on. Pushing a workflow change
  needs `gh auth refresh -s workflow` and `git -c credential.helper='!gh auth git-credential' push`.

## Permissions & guardrails (ways-of-work-lean-pass, 2026-09-17)

- **A deny rule matches command TEXT, and patching rules one at a time cannot close a rule CLASS.** A
  leading assignment whose value contains an expansion (`PATH=/x:$PATH vercel deploy --prod`) was observed
  live to escape a bare rule; patching only the rules someone had probed left `vercel --yes --prod`,
  `rm -fr`, `supabase db reset` and `git -C <path> push --force` matching nothing — found one per review
  round. Generate the three spellings (bare, `*=*`, `env *`) from a list the contract checks, so a
  bare-only rule fails CI rather than waiting for a reader.
- **`ask` escapes the same way, and an escaped ask is worse than an escaped deny** — it silently demotes
  "a human decides" to "the classifier decides". Carry ask rules in all three spellings too.
- **`*=*` matches an `=` anywhere in the line.** A `Bash(*=* vercel*)` catch-all hard-refused
  `grep -rn --include=*.json vercel .` — ordinary reading, permanently blocked. Keep prefixed rules per
  dangerous subcommand and pin the safe negations; a guard that rejects correct output gets bypassed.
- **`Write(<path>)` rules are INERT** — Claude Code checks only `Edit(<path>)` for file tools, and a nested
  `claude -p` refuses to start while one is present. This repo had seven of them on the design-system
  files, all protecting nothing; the paired `Edit` rules were doing the whole job.
- **Claude Code refuses a `PATH=`-prefixed command itself** — "prepending a directory to PATH before
  invoking git is a binary-hijacking pattern", even with that command explicitly allowed. Probe the
  prefixed rule forms with a plain assignment (`FOO=1 …`), which runs; a probe the platform will not run
  can never have a baseline, so it can never prove a rule.
- **A behavioural test needs a baseline the system will actually produce.** `permissions-smoke --live` asks
  a throwaway session to run each probe with NO rules, so that a later refusal proves the rule. Told the
  probes were harmless shims, and with the commands explicitly allowed, a session still **refuses**
  `rm -rf`, a force push or a deploy on its own judgement — so those probes can have no baseline, and the
  replay can only speak for the benign ones (the staging family). Three more faults surfaced on its first
  real run: a shim file named `PATH=/x:$PATH`, a temp workspace Claude Code treated as UNTRUSTED (so it
  ignored the rules under test, keyed by the resolved `/private/var/…` path), and ~300 probes overflowing a
  session that has no `--max-turns` to raise. A test that has never gone green has not tested anything yet.
- **An ALLOW skips the auto-mode classifier**, so the allow list is not "safe verbs" in the abstract — it is
  the set of commands that run with no second look, and it must never contain one that destroys work.

## Delegating prose to a cheap model
- **A cheap model summarising a dense engineering commit will fabricate, and its two failure modes are
  predictable enough to write into the prompt.** Measured over three live runs of
  `scripts/commit-report.mjs` (2026-07-25): (1) it **invents a beneficiary** — "Tenants now benefit
  from a faster test suite", for work no tenant can observe; (2) far worse, it **reports a fix that
  did not happen**, because commit messages here routinely cite a past incident to explain why present
  work matters. Given a commit that only ADDED TESTS for an open-redirect bug fixed weeks earlier, it
  wrote "the previous backslash bypass is blocked, eliminating a potential open-redirect attack."
  Confident, plausible, false, and landing in the channel the product owner reads as status. **Both are
  fixable by naming the exact failure in the prompt with the false sentence quoted** (run 3 came back
  accurate on every count), and neither is eliminated — so keep these tools **advisory**: print by
  default, post opt-in, and label the message so an unreviewed machine claim is self-identifying.
- **A model constant is a silent-rot surface: an unrecognized `--model` does not fail, it substitutes.**
  `prose-draft.mjs` held agy's pre-1.1.5 display names for a whole release cycle after the slug rename,
  so every draft ran on agy's default model — exit 0, no warning, plausible output. The rail's own
  comment had *predicted* exactly this ("a future typo would silently review with the WRONG model
  instead of failing loud") and it shipped anyway, because the prediction guarded the two constants the
  doctor checked and these lived somewhere it never looked. **The fix for a predicted-but-unguarded
  failure is structural, not a re-typing: put every instance in ONE registry the checker walks
  (`AGY_MODELS_IN_USE`), so a new consumer inherits the check instead of needing to remember it.**
  *(2026-07-25.)*
- **Wire the fallback to the CONDITION, not to one of its signatures.** `runAntigravity` fell back to
  the second model only on EMPTY output, so when `gpt-oss-120b` answered "Our servers are experiencing
  high traffic right now" with a **non-zero exit**, it aborted instead of trying the separate capacity
  pool sitting right there. Same transient condition, different exit code, no fallback. Classify
  transient failures explicitly (`isTransientAgyError`) and keep the pattern **tight** — a loose match
  on "error"/"failed" would convert a real contract break into a silent retry, which is precisely the
  1.0.10 incident this repo already paid for. *(2026-07-25.)*

## Working efficiently
- **A new npm scope is an owned namespace, not a label the first publish creates.** A scoped publish
  can authenticate successfully and still fail `Scope not found` until the organization exists;
  creating that organization is its own outward decision about owner and package plan. On the first
  package, a registry PUT 200, public access, a dist-tag and even a rendered package page can precede
  the metadata document used by `npm install`. The release proof is a clean install and import from a
  new directory; only then deprecate the old package. *(2026-08-13, frijoles-rebrand-closeout.)*
- **An authenticated page sweep must assert it reached authenticated content before measuring it.**
  The anonymous browser project followed signed-in routes to `/login`, so the mobile rail measured a
  clean redirect and looked complete while covering none of the product. Reuse the real auth rail,
  assert status/session/no-login first, then apply the shared geometry helper. The first honest run
  found undersized sortable headers and two overflowing table surfaces. *(2026-08-13,
  frijoles-rebrand-closeout.)*
- **`SUPABASE_DB_URL` must be exported for the local `api` gate, or ~30 specs fail on a
  precondition that has nothing to do with your diff.** `npm run test:e2e` locally without it fails
  with `SUPABASE_DB_URL must target local Supabase on loopback port 54322` from
  `e2e/helpers/test-db-cleanup.ts`, in specs spread across every subsystem — which reads exactly
  like a broad regression. Export
  `SUPABASE_DB_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres"` alongside
  `supabase start` and the freshly-built server. **And when a suite fails in areas your change never
  touched, get a baseline before explaining it away**: checking out `main`, rebuilding and running
  the same specs took five minutes and turned "13 unrelated failures, probably environmental" into a
  fact (identical 13 on `main`, all green in CI). *(2026-08-12, landing-redesign-v2.)*
- **A full-page screenshot at small scale is not a measurement either.** "Verify a visual claim by
  RENDERING, not by grepping" has a second half: a rendered image can also be read wrong. A
  translucency effect judged "nearly invisible on our dark ground" from a full-page screenshot was
  measurably the OPPOSITE — the dark ground changed more than the light one (mean channel delta
  15.13/255 vs 10.44), because a bright element passing under the bar has far more contrast against
  near-black. Pulling a circuit breaker on that impression would have cut a working feature on false
  evidence. **Isolate the element and compute a number before concluding.**
  *(2026-08-20, methodology-experience.)*
- **`async generateMetadata` does not make a Next.js page dynamic.** A statically generated route
  evaluates it at BUILD time, so `getSiteUrl()` froze whatever `SITE_URL` the build had — and this
  repo's CI builds with none, baking `rel="canonical" href="http://localhost:3000/…"` into the HTML.
  A canonical tag pointing at localhost is worse than none: it tells a crawler the real page is
  somewhere it cannot reach. `force-dynamic` is required alongside it. Assert the STRUCTURAL property
  (`x-nextjs-prerender` absent) and not just the rendered URL, because a harness that builds WITH
  `SITE_URL` set produces a correct-looking value either way. *(2026-08-20, methodology-experience.)*
- **Verify against a freshly built artifact, or you will diagnose the wrong cause — confidently.**
  A CSS rule appeared absent from the running page, and the plausible explanation (the minifier
  mangles `:where(:has())`) went into a code comment as fact. It was false twice over: the grep that
  "proved" it was matching inside the `:where(`, and the page was being served by a **stale build**.
  The rule compiles fine. What almost shipped was not a broken selector but a confident, wrong
  explanation in a comment, which the next reader would have trusted (CODE-QUALITY #3). Two rules
  fall out: kill the server and rebuild before concluding anything about compiled output, and
  **never write the verification and the conclusion in one step** — establish the fact on a clean
  environment first, then write the sentence. *(2026-08-12, landing-redesign-v2.)*
- **A descendant "default" at (0,1,1) silently outranks every single-class rule it should defer to.**
  `.panel p { color: var(--dim) }` beat `.takeaway`, `.micro--gold` and `.tier__price` on elements
  inside a panel: text rendered dim, a headline price rendered at body size, and every call site
  looked correct. Nothing errors, and the fix at the call site (raise specificity there too) makes it
  worse. Descendant rules that exist as **defaults for unclassed elements** belong in `:where()`, so
  they are a floor any class can step over rather than a ceiling every class must fight. Same
  reasoning as the mobile rails in the same epic. *(2026-08-12, landing-redesign-v2.)*
- **Fix the CLASS with a spec, not the instance the reviewer named.** Review found one unlabelled
  illustration on the landing page. Editing that one label would have closed the finding; writing a
  spec that asserts *every* framed surface declares itself real-or-illustrated found **two more** the
  reviewer never reached. When a finding is an instance of a property the surface should have, the
  cheapest correct response is usually the assertion, not the edit. *(2026-08-12, landing-redesign-v2.)*
- **Before believing a local test failure is your diff, run the identical command on clean `main`.**
  Two "regressions" in one epic were the environment: `npm run test:e2e:local` BUILDS into
  `apps/web/.next`, so a `next dev` server left running in the same worktree corrupts it and every
  page route 404s with *"Cannot append headers after they are sent to the client"* — twelve failures
  that look exactly like a real break, including `/app` → `/login`. The other was a spec failing on
  accumulated local fixture data while green on CI's fresh DB. A checkout of the merge base and one
  re-run settles it in minutes and is far cheaper than reasoning about the diff. Kill the dev server
  before the local gate; `rm -rf apps/web/.next` if you already crossed them.
  *(2026-08-09, app-component-kit-adoption.)* **A second trigger, same corruption:** `npm run
  typecheck` rebuilds the `@golden-frijoles/sdk` workspace, which invalidates a live `next dev`'s
  chunks — `/_next/static/chunks/*.js` then 404, the page never hydrates, and exactly the specs that
  need client JS fail (clipboard, the Ops tablist) with no defect in the components. Symptom to
  recognise: a spec you did not touch fails reproducibly right after you ran the static gate. Restart
  dev, re-run, and do not go looking in the components. *(2026-08-20,
  landing-readability-pass.)*
- **Amending a locked acceptance criterion is a product-owner decision, not a documentation task.**
  Writing the reasoning down is necessary and not sufficient — cross-review correctly flagged an
  amendment as Blocking scope change even though it was recorded with measurements and a rationale.
  Put it as an explicit either/or **with a recommendation**, then record the answer as a dated
  amendment. Distinguish the two kinds: a *prediction falsified by measurement* ("less code") drops
  no work and only needs recording; *dropped scope* ("this route is included") needs the ask.
  *(2026-08-09, app-component-kit-adoption S2.)*
- **Cowork's folder mounts deny `unlink` by default, so ANY lock-taking git command can strand a
  `.git/*.lock` — the command does not have to fail.** The mount permits create and write but not
  delete, anywhere in the tree (not just under `.git`), so git's normal lock cleanup is what breaks.
  A plain `git status` that needed to refresh the index stranded an `index.lock` during the
  post-mortem itself. **The remedy is `allow_cowork_file_delete`** — a Cowork tool whose own
  description says to call it whenever a delete fails with "Operation not permitted" *rather than
  telling the user it is impossible*. One call per folder, the owner approves, and `rm` works
  normally for the rest of the session. `GIT_INDEX_FILE=/tmp/i` is a **partial** mitigation only: it
  relocates the *index* lock and does nothing for a **ref** lock
  (`.git/refs/heads/<branch>.lock`), which is the kind that actually blocked the owner here and that
  no amount of precondition-checking prevents. Also set `user.name` AND `user.email` (a `-c` flag
  per commit is enough); the sandbox has no global identity, and a missing *name* fails with a
  message about the *email*. **Committing from Cowork is normal and expected — handing the product
  owner a shell script to do it is a REGRESSION, not a workaround.** Only `push` routinely needs
  them, and for a real reason: the sandbox has no `gh`, no git credentials, and `api.github.com` is
  proxy-blocked, while plain `git fetch`/`ls-remote` over HTTPS works. *(2026-08-06, corrected same
  day — the first version of this entry blamed a failing `git mv` and declared the lock
  undeletable; both were wrong.)*
- **Don't theorise a capability wall from a single failure — probe the boundary, then act, and
  check whether the host offers a tool for the wall before declaring it load-bearing.** Same
  session: one stranded lock was read as "the sandbox cannot commit", and a whole
  hand-the-owner-a-script workflow got built on that premise before anything was tested. The first
  correction probed harder and found `GIT_INDEX_FILE` and the missing `user.name` — but still
  stopped one step short, concluding the lock file itself was undeletable and handing over a
  cleanup command that named three paths, **none of which existed**. The actual affordance
  (`allow_cowork_file_delete`) was one tool-search away. Probing beats theorising, but *"I probed
  and found a workaround"* is not the same as *"I found the mechanism"* — a workaround that leaves
  the owner running commands is a signal you have not reached the mechanism yet. *(2026-08-06.)*
- **A plugin enabled in a project's `.claude/settings.json` reaches Claude Code and NOT Cowork.**
  `extraKnownMarketplaces` + `enabledPlugins` is Claude Code's mechanism; Cowork loads its own
  installed-skill set from the desktop app. So a skill can be enabled in a repo for months, work in
  every Claude Code session, and be silently absent in Cowork — which is what happened to `groom`,
  the one skill explicitly written *for* Cowork. Install it there separately: `node
  scripts/pack-skills.mjs --skill <name>` builds a `.skill` archive, presenting that file in chat
  renders a **Save/Update skill** button, and pressing it *is* the install — that button is the only
  thing that changes what Cowork loads. **Symptom to recognise: an agent says a skill "isn't loaded"
  while you can see it enabled in the repo — check WHICH host you are in before concluding the
  plugin is broken.** Two traps found the hard way: (1) `save_skill` carries **only** SKILL.md, so
  using it on a skill with bundled generators produces a silently crippled one-file install — use
  the `.skill` archive whenever the skill ships more than prose; (2) a skill that invokes its own
  bundled scripts must **resolve** their directory, since the plugin puts them at
  `skills/<name>/` and a Cowork install puts them at the skill's root — hardcoding either shape is
  correct on one host and silently wrong on the other. *(2026-08-06.)*
- **A sandboxed authentication check can be a false negative when the credential lives in an OS
  keyring.** `gh auth status` inside the filesystem sandbox reported an invalid default token while
  Git push through the macOS credential manager succeeded; the same `gh auth status` with keyring
  access correctly reported the logged-in `danybgoode` account and scopes. Treat contradictory
  evidence as a rail mismatch to investigate, not a reason to tell the owner to log in again. Verify
  on the credential-owning rail and test the intended operation. *(2026-08-01, flag-serving closeout.)*
- **A live-proof handoff is not proof that the live proof is still pending — read the scoped immutable
  ledger before repeating production work.** The activation doc ended at "gates ON," so re-entry
  initially concluded the two runs and breaker transitions were missing. Tenant-scoped scenario,
  impact and breaker snapshots showed they had already completed: terminal runs, expected security
  guard, non-zero canonical impact, two protective trips and a revoked target. The read prevented a
  duplicate production exercise. *(2026-08-01, flag-serving closeout.)*
- **A complete flag import is a snapshot, not an ongoing registration rail.** After Miyagi cut over
  with `*=golden`, a later `catalog.owned_shop_only_enabled` key had no Golden definition and resolved
  safely from its explicit local default with reason `DEFAULT`. The default-ON kill-switch contract
  was correct; treating permanent control-plane absence as an exception was not. A project declares
  the typed default once, then a generic project-scoped sync rail must register it without a Golden-side
  whitelist. Local defaults are resilience, not the operational writer. Never call the original
  inventory evergreen or infer the operational project from a similar slug or old proof note. Verify the
  current owner project and the actual runtime credential's snapshot separately. If the established
  credential serves a different live catalog, do not swap it wholesale: route only the new exact key to a
  scoped provider and keep that provider's project-relative snapshot out of the shared mirror. Finally,
  activation makes an immutable version authoritative; a no-rules version whose default is OFF remains
  OFF until a new default-ON version is activated. *(2026-08-01, corrected 2026-08-09 and 2026-08-10;
  flag-serving / owned-shop / Partners recruiting.)*
- **A Next App Router `loading.tsx` or parent layout can change the HTTP semantics of a guarded
  child page by starting the response stream first.** During the design-system lift, both a shared
  `/app` layout and then the root loader made `notFound()` content look correct in a browser while
  the dark-path API contract regressed from 404 to 200. Keep feature/auth guards above any shared
  shell that can stream; render the shell inside the page after the guard, and use client-side
  navigation/submission feedback when the status code itself is part of the contract. Pin it with
  request-level status tests, not screenshots alone. *(2026-07-28.)* **Hit again by a builder who had not re-read
  this** (portfolio-view S2, 2026-10-03): a route `loading.tsx` served `/app/portfolio?workspace=<foreign>` as 200. The
  fix that held: decide every 404/redirect in the page, then put the slow part in an in-page `<Suspense>` — the
  fallback IS the approved loading state.
- **A spec that rewrites a hidden input must prove the rewrite took before it submits.** portfolio-view's forged-id
  test first passed by never forging: the hidden `projectId` was a React-controlled `value`, hydration put the real id
  back, and the "forged" submit was the owner's own. Use `defaultValue` for hidden form fields, rewrite after the page
  is interactive, and assert `toHaveValue(forged)` — a refused forgery and an ignored one otherwise look identical.
  *(2026-10-03, portfolio-view S2.)*
- **A thrown Server Action error is reported as the PAGE failing.** It lands in the route's `error.tsx` ("couldn't
  load…") and Next redacts its message in production, so an owner's failed save read as an outage. Redirect back with a
  named outcome the page renders (whitelisted keys, `Object.hasOwn`) instead of throwing. *(2026-10-03, portfolio-view S2,
  fresh reviewer.)*
- **On a UI sprint, someone has to OPEN THE PAGE. A full green gate does not see layout.**
  app-shell-and-agent-rail S2 shipped two real defects past typecheck, lint, 883 unit tests, build,
  the drift guard, 435 api specs and 14 authed browser specs — both found by looking at a screenshot
  the browser smoke had already produced and nobody had read: (1) the fixed rail sat ON TOP of the
  page content from ~1080px, because the layout reserved the rail's WIDTH but not the GUTTER it was
  inset by — two numbers where there should have been one derived value; (2) `tokens.css`'
  `section { padding: 36px 0 }`, written for the landing's page bands, opened **72px of dead air per
  section** inside a 320px sidebar, which reads as a rendering failure rather than a quiet day.
  Neither is expressible as "the element exists" or "no horizontal overflow", which is what the
  specs asserted. **Assertions cover the properties you thought to name; a screenshot covers the ones
  you did not.** Take one per viewport on any sprint that moves pixels, look at it, and convert what
  you find into geometry assertions (`boundingBox()` comparisons) so the SPECIFIC regression cannot
  return — while accepting that the next unnamed one still needs an eye. *(2026-08-07,
  app-shell-and-agent-rail S2.)*
- **Deleting a stacked PR's base branch on merge CLOSES it, irreversibly.** Merging the bottom of a
  three-PR stack with `gh pr merge --delete-branch` auto-closed the PR above it, and GitHub will not
  reopen *or* retarget a PR closed that way — the review record (two cross-family rounds and the
  responses) was stranded on a closed thread and the work needed a fresh PR pointing back at it.
  **Merge a stack without `--delete-branch` until the last one, or retarget each PR to `main` before
  merging the one below it.** *(2026-08-07, app-shell-and-agent-rail.)*
- **A review CLI that cannot open a file will invent "this is missing" findings — check what your
  reviewer can actually READ before blaming the model.** Three confidently-wrong findings across one
  epic ("the helper is not defined in this test file" — defined eight lines above the hunk; "an audit
  action carries no project_id" — the source passes one explicitly; "imported from a file the diff
  never creates" — a lower PR in the stack creates it) all shared one cause: the reviewer was handed
  a DIFF and no repo access. For vibe specifically the cause was ours — `--trust` only skips the
  trust-the-FOLDER prompt and approves no tool calls, so every read was auto-denied AND each denial
  burned a turn against `--max-turns 4`, producing intermittent "Turn limit reached" failures that
  looked like a quota problem. The fix is `--auto-approve` **scoped by** `--enabled-tools` to
  `read_file` and `grep`, which in programmatic mode disables everything else — reads granted, writes
  still impossible, verified by attempting the write and getting `TOOL_UNAVAILABLE`. **The general
  rule: a truncation or an odd finding from a review CLI is a question about its INVOCATION before it
  is a question about its quota, and the diagnostic is one `--output json` run to see whether its
  tool calls are being approved or denied.** *(2026-08-07, PR #77.)*
- **Write down what is NOT covered, or nobody will schedule the fast-follow.** app-shell-and-agent-rail
  shipped two guarantees without tests and said so in the retro under "coverage stated rather than
  implied": a rail catch-to-null that needed a broken service-role client to exercise, and a CSS fix
  found by eye. Both were closed the next day precisely because they were named. **An unstated gap is
  indistinguishable from an oversight** — and the honest sentence costs one line, while the
  alternative is a reader who assumes the green gate covered it. *(2026-08-07, app-shell-and-agent-rail.)*
- **Session length is set by a measured line, not a stamina rule.** A whole epic in one session is the
  main context-cost driver, and the durable state (the plan file, sprint docs, team memory) makes
  re-entry cheap by design — so checkpoint or hand off when the budget line says so (its thresholds
  live in one table, `THRESHOLDS` in groom's `session-budget.mjs`), not per sprint. Groom's twin rule is "one deep ask
  per approval gate". *(Sharpened 2026-09-30, session-budget: "fresh session per sprint" was set for
  earlier models.)*
- **A local gate that is a SUBSET of CI's gate is worse than no local gate, because it produces a
  green that does not mean what CI means by green.** pod-report S3 burned three push-and-wait round
  trips on static checks that run in seconds locally — lint, then prettier's changed-files check, then
  the TEST tsconfigs. The last one is the instructive one: `tsc --noEmit -p apps/web` passed while
  `npm run typecheck` failed, because the latter checks FOUR projects (app, app-tests, sdk,
  sdk-tests) and the error was in a test fixture whose object literal narrows more tightly than the
  runtime type. **Invoke CI's own npm scripts, never a hand-written approximation of them**, and run
  them in CI's order so the cheapest fails first.
  **The same holds for a workflow you assemble from its steps by hand.** think-skills S2 ran six skills-ci checks by
  name, missed the groom prose-budget step, and went red. Run every step from the workflow file itself (parse its
  `run:` blocks and skip only the ones that install global CLIs), against the same tree CI uses (here, the subtree
  split). *(2026-10-01, think-skills #215.)*
  **Derive the step list from the workflow file every time, never from memory — each red step hides the next.**
  sketch-specs paid for this rule a second time in the same order: lint went red, and once fixed, the Format step
  behind it went red on the next push (CI stops at the first failure, so a reviewer cannot see past it either). The
  fix that held was listing the job's `run:` lines from `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and replaying all of them locally
  before the push. *(2026-09-30, sketch-specs.)* ci-diet paid it twice more in one epic (a stale BUILD-ORDER, then a
  mirrored spec edited once), each time after running only `test:unit`. *(2026-10-04.)*
- **Re-derive a handover's status from the artifact, never from the previous session's summary.**
  pod-report Sprint 2's close-out said all four stories were built. Two claims did not survive a check
  against `origin/main`, the production database and the live site: `--push` printed "not wired yet"
  and exited **0** (so production held zero artifacts while runs looked successful), and a module the
  doc said was "built against the real `miyagisanchez` tenant" had **zero callers**. Both were written
  in good faith by a session that had genuinely done the hard half. The cheap checks that found it:
  one `select kind, count(*) … group by kind` against prod, one `curl -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}'`,
  and one grep for callers. *(2026-07-26.)*
- **Never infer which rail a credential serves from what the credential is NAMED.** golden-beans'
  `SELF_PROJECT_API_KEY` authenticates as the **demo** tenant, not the self tenant. A landing section
  was switched to read the self tenant on the strength of that name and shipped rendering its fallback
  teaser in production. Confirm by asking the data which tenant a write actually landed on. This is
  the same lesson as the earlier "don't infer a provider from a secret's name" entry, one level in.
  *(2026-07-26.)*
- **A GitHub Actions workflow env var exported via `$GITHUB_ENV` only reaches steps AFTER that
  point in the job — never an already-running background process from an earlier step.**
  commercial-shell Sprint 3's CI exported a freshly-minted `SELF_PROJECT_API_KEY` right before
  seeding a new tenant, but the `npm run start &` background server had already forked several
  steps earlier — so the running process never saw it, and every tracking call for the rest of the
  job silently no-op'd (0 events, no error, by design — that's what made it non-obvious). Fix:
  generate/export anything a long-running background process needs to read from its env BEFORE
  starting that process, not after — even if the value is only used by a LATER step logically.
- **Actions minutes stopped being the constraint when the repo went public (public-monorepo, 2026-09-28):
  GitHub-hosted standard runners are free for public repositories, so wall clock is what's scarce.** The old premise
  ("minutes are a recurring account-wide constraint", from two exhaustions in July 2026 while the repo was private)
  kept steering CI design for weeks after it stopped being true: one sequential e2e job to save a checkout, the
  browser rails kept out of the gate "to save minutes". ci-diet (2026-10-04) rewrote it here, in `ci.yml` and in
  `dependabot.yml`. **Re-check a cost premise when the thing it costs changes.** If the repo ever goes private again,
  minutes come back: batch pushes, verify locally first (`npm run test:e2e:local`), and revisit the parallel jobs.
- **CI's rules, distilled from the incident histories `ci.yml` used to carry (ci-diet, 2026-10-04).** Each one bit
  more than once; the narratives are in git history before `ci-diet` S1.
  - **A gate a spec branches on is read twice**: the server decides behaviour, the test process decides expectation.
    Copied flag lists drifted four times ("set in both places"). One file per gate state (`ci/gates.{on,off}.env`),
    loaded into `$GITHUB_ENV` before the server boots, makes them agree by construction.
  - **Run a whole Playwright project, never a positional file list.** A list missed seven authed suites, one at a
    time, each found after it had already hidden a defect.
  - **A path filter is a claim about what can break a rule, and it was wrong once.** The blocking gate runs
    unfiltered; anything skipped is skipped by an exclusion rule that falls back to running everything.
  - **`cmd | tee` under GitHub's default `bash -e` reports tee's status**: `set -o pipefail`, or the step is green
    whatever `cmd` did.
  - **Never hardcode a local Supabase key in a workflow.** A CLI bump changed the key format once; export what
    `supabase status -o env` issued in this run.
  - **Every command in an EXIT trap needs `|| true` under `set -e`.** A `kill -9` on an already-exited server became
    the step's exit status, and the step went red with 30/30 passed (ci-diet S1).
  - **Run a new CI step from a checkout without your `.env.local` before pushing it.** `check-quarantine` listed tests
    fine locally and failed closed on every PR in CI, because listing imports a spec that reads Supabase env at load
    (ci-diet S3, fresh reviewer).
  - **Folding a date-based guard into the blocking gate changes who it blocks.** Jev's shadow expiry, once
    path-filtered, would have turned every PR red on its date; it runs daily instead. Decide per guard whether a lapsed
    date should stop all merges (a quarantine's expiry: yes, by design) or only page someone.
  - **A quarantine can take a security proof out of the gate.** The flaky steps of the first quarantined test were the
    only end-to-end check of a Server Action's authorization wiring. Before quarantining, name what the test is the
    sole guard for, and shorten the expiry to match (ci-diet: 14 days, not 30).
- **The auto-mode-classifier trap: in auto mode the classifier passes READS and blocks production
  WRITES + shell CREDENTIAL-handling — that is the whole rule. Don't build a security-philosophy
  theory on top of a few blocks; probe the read/write boundary empirically first.** (2026-07-20,
  commercial-shell Story 3.3 launch — the session's single biggest time-sink.) A run of "Blocked by
  the Claude Code auto mode classifier" denials got mis-diagnosed as an intent-proof `hard_deny`
  security boundary around "minting production credentials" (a spawned Opus planning agent
  confidently reinforced this). Wrong: a read-only `ls` and a `supabase db query --linked "select …"`
  passed, while an `insert`, a `node -e` generating a key, and `vercel env add <secret>` blocked —
  the real axis is **read vs. write / secret-handling**, and it's the *mode*, not a project
  misconfig or a hidden rule (the user had defined no `autoMode.*` rules at all). Two mundane
  unlocks, no settings edit and no weakening of the classifier: **(1) leave auto mode** (Shift+Tab)
  so prod writes surface as ordinary approve-prompts the owner clears live; **(2) do all prod DB
  work through the already-logged-in `supabase db query --linked`** (uses the CLI's own auth — no
  `service_role` key in the shell at all) **with any credentials generated *inside* the SQL query**
  (`encode(digest(x,'sha256'),'hex')` for an api-key hash, `gen_random_uuid()` for token/key
  material) so no secret ever touches a shell command. This also sidesteps the `sb_secret_…` vs
  `eyJ…` (JWT) service-role-key-format confusion that made a hand-run seed script fail with "Invalid
  API key." Do NOT try to edit `autoMode.hard_deny/soft_deny` to route around a block — hard_deny is
  designed to be unreachable by in-chat agency, so an agent editing it on chat instruction defeats
  the category by construction; hand the owner the mechanical step (or, as here, just leave auto
  mode). Corollary: don't spawn a planning agent to rationalize a wall before you've empirically
  mapped what actually passes vs. blocks — a confident wrong theory is worse than no theory.

- **A worktree with no `node_modules` silently resolves workspace packages to the ROOT checkout,
  so package edits look inert and unit tests assert against the wrong branch.**
  (2026-08-09, `flags-visual-rule-builder` S1.) `@golden-beans/sdk` resolved to the root checkout's
  `dist` — on `main`, without the branch's changes — so `npm run build --workspace=…` wrote to a
  `dist/` nothing imported, an SDK edit appeared to have no effect, and the SDK unit tests were
  quietly green against code the branch had already changed. **`npm install` inside the worktree
  first**, then confirm with `node -e "console.log(require.resolve('@golden-beans/sdk'))"` before
  trusting a single package-touching test result. (Related to the two worktree entries above, but a
  different failure: those are about tooling that cannot RUN; this one runs fine and lies.)
- **A positional locator over two identically-worded controls is a spec that will silently start
  testing something else.** (2026-08-10, `flags-visual-rule-builder` S2, amendment A9.) A rejection
  probe used `getByRole('button', { name: 'Create immutable version' }).first()`; a later sprint
  added a second form with the same verb, rendered FIRST, whose button is disabled while its form has
  problems — so the probe would have waited on an unclickable element instead of testing anything.
  A second locator, `.locator('pre').first()`, would have re-pointed the same way the moment a flag
  had two versions. **Scope by the control that distinguishes the two surfaces** (`.filter({ has:
  page.locator('#flag-definition') })`), never by position. It went unnoticed because the `authed`
  Playwright project does not run in CI — which is the second half of the lesson: **a spec no
  pipeline runs is a spec that decays silently.**
- **Stop cross-agent review at a CLEAN ROUND, not at a round count — and a clean round means every
  reviewer, including the context-independent one.** (2026-08-10, `flags-visual-rule-builder` S2:
  **seven rounds, sixteen real defects**.) Round 4 was clean from *both* external families and the
  fresh reviewer found a **regression that round 3's own fix had introduced**; rounds 5 and 6 each
  found one more path after the second family had gone clean three rounds running. Two corollaries
  worth as much as the rule: **(a) a fix deserves the same suspicion as the code it replaces** — one
  derivation here was corrected three times in three rounds, each time for a *different* wrong
  statement about the same data, and the third fix moved a guard behind a filter and broke a fourth
  thing. Again in `intent-match` (2026-09-30): indenting a model reply to stop its fences breaking a section made
  the scanner's `\s*` fence rule treat the indented fences as real, and an odd one then deleted every later
  section — only a fresh round caught it; **(b) when several findings share one cause, the cause is the finding** — four separate
  "guard this shape" reports on a JSONB-backed seam were one sentence (*a TypeScript type over a
  JSONB column is a promise the database does not make*), and guarding each field by hand was
  building a second validator, always one review finding behind. Ask the existing authority once.
- **A comment that asserts a property is code, and goes stale like code — the dangerous kind reads
  as an unfinished task.** (2026-08-10, `flags-visual-rule-builder`.) Three separate review rounds
  found a comment claiming something the code did not do, including a `satisfies` said to enforce
  exhaustiveness that did not, and a CSS note instructing the next adoption pass to apply a class
  that the epic had just decided must NOT be applied (it would have broken a dark-launch guarantee).
  When a decision reverses, **retire the note in the same PR**; a leftover "do this next sprint" is a
  landmine with a friendly face.
- **Playwright's `toContainText` NORMALISES WHITESPACE, so a trailing-`\n` guard against a numeric
  prefix silently asserts nothing — and a negative one can be impossible to satisfy.** (2026-08-10,
  `flags-visual-rule-builder`, found the first time the `authed` project was ever run.) The epic's
  single most important check was `await expect(json).not.toContainText('"basisPoints": 10\n')`,
  written to catch a factor-of-100 error. Normalisation strips the newline, leaving
  `"basisPoints": 10` — a **prefix of the correct `"basisPoints": 1000`** — so the guard failed on a
  CORRECT build and could never have passed on any build. **Assert on parsed values, not on rendered
  substrings**: `JSON.parse(await locator.innerText()).rules[0].rollout.basisPoints === 1000` cannot
  be blurred by rendering, and a `toEqual` between the builder's preview and the stored version
  states the round-trip claim directly. Then mutation-check it — dropping the `× 100` must turn it
  red, and here it does.


---
- **Dedupe merged docs by content, not by the heading or bold lead.** When `one-roadmap` merged two LEARNINGS files,
  a lead-only match counted an entry as a duplicate even though one repo had grown it a corollary, so the extension
  was silently lost. Compare the whole entry, and keep the longer one. *(one-roadmap, 2026-09-28)*
- **`git stash` + `git stash pop` puts staged deletions back as unstaged.** A commit made afterwards silently leaves
  out every `git rm`. After any stash round trip, re-stage with `git add -u <path>` and read `git show --stat`
  before pushing. *(one-roadmap, 2026-09-28)*
- **Never squash-merge a PR whose history is the deliverable**, such as a `git subtree add`. A squash flattens the merge to
  one parent, `git subtree split` then roots a brand-new history, and the mirror can never fast-forward again. State
  "merge commit" in the PR and check the split SHA after the merge. *(public-monorepo, 2026-09-28)*
- **Check the hosting plan before moving a repo into an org.** Vercel Hobby can't connect an org-owned repo, so a
  transfer would have silently stopped "merge = deploy". A rename in the same account keeps the link, because Vercel
  tracks the `repoId`. *(public-monorepo, 2026-09-28)*
- **Never filter `git push` output down to the success lines.** A pre-push hook refused the push, the filter hid the
  refusal, and a PR comment cited a SHA that never reached GitHub. Check `git status -sb` for `[ahead N]` after every
  push. *(public-monorepo, 2026-09-28)*

## From the plugin repo (moved 2026-09-28)
*`golden-frijoles/skills` (formerly dobby-foundation) kept its own LEARNINGS until [`one-roadmap`](09-platform-infra/one-roadmap/README.md) moved its Roadmap here. These are its entries that were not already in this file, verbatim under their original section headings. Merging them into the sections above is `doc-hygiene`'s job.*

### Tooling gotchas

- **Every spec that builds a git fixture must clear `GIT_DIR` and friends.** git exports them into hooks,
  from a linked worktree they point at the real repo, and they override `cwd`. So a fixture's `git init` /
  `config` / `commit` rewrites the real repository: `core.bare=true`, identity `t <t@t>`, junk commits on
  `main`. It happened three times (2026-09-09, -16, -23), each time sealed in one file only.
  `template/scripts/git-fixtures-sealed.test.mjs` now fails the class. *(2026-09-23)*
  **A fourth time, 2026-10-06, past that guard:** its detector matched `git('init'` but not the cwd-first helper
  `git(root, 'init', …)`, and a worktree pre-push flipped `core.bare` again. A class guard keyed on call SHAPES needs
  a case per shape you have actually written; it now has one (#278). Its scan still stops at `scripts/` — `packages/`
  specs are sealed by hand.
- **Never put markdown in a double-quoted shell string.** The backticks in `node -e "…`codex login`…"` are
  command substitution: they started an OAuth flow and logged a CLI out. Put data scripts in files
  (heredoc with a quoted delimiter). *(2026-09-23)*

### Permissions & guardrails (ways-of-work-lean-pass, 2026-09-16)

- **A deny rule is text matching, and a per-rule patch cannot close a rule CLASS.** A leading assignment
  whose value contains an expansion (`PATH=/x:$PATH vercel deploy --prod`) was observed LIVE to escape a bare
  rule. Patching the four rules someone had probed left `vercel --yes --prod`, `rm -fr`, `supabase db reset`,
  `git push origin +main`, `git -C <path> push --force` and `npx supabase --debug db push` matching nothing —
  found one at a time across four review rounds. Generate the spellings from a list the contract checks
  (`CRITICAL_COMMANDS` → bare + `*=*` + `env *`), so a bare-only rule fails CI instead of waiting for a reader.
- **The same escape applies to `ask`, where it is WORSE.** An escaped deny is a gap; an escaped ask is a
  silent downgrade from "a human decides" to "the classifier decides". Carry ask rules in all three spellings
  too, and treat a deny that swallows an ask as a finding — a refusal cannot be approved once.
- **`*=*` matches an `=` ANYWHERE, not an assignment prefix.** `Bash(*=* vercel*)` hard-refused
  `grep -rn --include=*.json vercel .` — ordinary reading. Keep prefixed rules per dangerous SUBCOMMAND and
  pin the safe negations in a `MUST_NOT_DENY` list; a guard that rejects correct output gets bypassed.
- **`Write(<path>)` permission rules are INERT** — Claude Code checks only `Edit(<path>)` for file tools, and
  a nested `claude -p` refuses to start while one is present. `Edit` covers Write, Edit and NotebookEdit.
- **An ALLOW skips the classifier, so it must be read as "runs with no second look".** `Bash(node scripts/*)`
  pre-approved a script that writes production secrets through a REST call, while the `ask` rules guarded only
  the CLI path nobody used — one door guarded out of several. Deny the dangerous invocations by name.
- **Project-level `defaultMode: "auto"` is ignored AND masks the user default.** Auto mode is a user setting;
  a config guard should fail on the wrong-scope setting, not only on the missing one.
- **Say where the line is.** The deny list matches command text, so it is not a sandbox: wrappers (`nice`,
  `timeout`, `sudo`) and `/bin/rm` are out of scope by design. Write that boundary into the file, or the next
  reviewer re-finds it as a bug.

### Shared rails across repos (plugin-audit-and-extraction, 2026-09-18)

- **"Byte-identical" is a claim until a byte-compare runs.** Compare every template script against every
  consumer (`cmp` in a loop) before claiming one implementation per rail, and put every surviving
  difference in the consumer's own docs with a reason. The epic's walkthrough claimed it and was wrong on
  eight rails. The review finding that prompted the compare was itself a live bug: a callee's newly
  required flag that a caller never passed.
- **Replacing a file with the shared copy? Run the consumer's OLD tests against the NEW code.** The shared
  copy can be weaker than the local one it replaces. A consumer's stricter prose guard was silently undone
  that way, and the tests that pinned it were deleted as "superseded". `git show origin/main:<test>` into a
  temp file, run it, and read every failure. **Merging N forks: build the superset from the strongest copy,
  import the others' features BY NAME, and let the stricter copy win any safety property.** Then apply that
  property to EVERY runner, not the one in front of you. distribute-what-we-use locked Vibe down and
  re-admitted devin with the same host-read hole in the same round, and then the *default* reviewer (codex)
  turned out to have it too, with MCP servers loaded. *(2026-09-29)*
- **A review that skips "copies" cannot see a regression against the file the copy replaced.** Review the
  consumer's adoption against the consumer's previous version too, not only against the template.
- **"Could not look" is its own exit code, never the failure one.** A watchdog's missing, unloadable or
  empty assertion file exited 1 through an unhandled rejection, which a routine reads as "production is
  broken". Load inputs in a function that returns `{ok, error}`, and `.catch` `main()` into the
  could-not-look state. The same three-answer rule decides a *check's* severity: **configuration**
  (absent, rejected — true until a person acts) fails; **weather** (unreachable, timed out, a 404 from
  a switched-off surface) warns and exits 0; collapsing them is how a check starts failing builds for
  someone else's outage.

### Guards, and depending on someone else's service (golden-flags-by-default, 2026-09-19)

- **A guard that makes N files agree says nothing about whether they are RIGHT.** A parity check
  welded one command into five surfaces, and the command did not exist — `gf flags ls` takes no
  `--env`, so it exited 1 before reaching auth, and the output it told readers to look for was
  another tool's vocabulary. Every surface agreed, perfectly, about something untrue, and the build
  was one `--help` away from catching it. **Presence is not execution: if a doc tells someone to run
  a command, the check runs it.** A `--exec` mode that accepts "the parser took it, then asked for a
  credential" and rejects "unknown flag" is cheap, and it skips rather than failing when the tool is
  not installed.
- **Making a check EXECUTE makes it capable of whatever it checks — pay for that deliberately.**
  Replacing a grep with a real invocation is usually right, and the first version of one such check
  ran two write verbs (create-and-activate-in-production, kill-in-production) while inheriting the
  ambient credential: a documentation parity check, one `gf login` away from mutating a live
  catalog. The answer is not care. **Construct the harmless state** (a scrubbed env — blank token,
  `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` *and* `HOME` at an empty temp dir) **and then ASSERT it** — require the
  "refused for want of a credential" outcome, so a future failure of the isolation is loud instead
  of a silent pass. Prove it with a negative control that shows the credential IS found without the
  scrub.
- **A guard with no test is a guard nobody has seen fire, and a linter run is a guard.** ESLint pointed at files
  outside its configured paths lints nothing and prints nothing. That silent run once read as clean over 13
  orphaned bindings. Plant a violation (an unused variable) beside the files and require it to be reported.
  *(2026-09-23)*
- **A guard with no test is a guard nobody has seen fire.** `check-plugin-leaks.mjs` ran green over a
  real leak every day for months: "CI was green" cannot distinguish a working guard from a pattern that
  matches nothing. Give every guard fixtures that assert it **fires**, *and* fixtures that assert it does
  **not** fire on the thing it must permit. The same goes for an assertion of absence: a "returns 404" test needs a positive
  anchor (the same caller gets 200 on its own project), or a broken fixture passes it for the wrong reason.
  *(2026-10-01, think-skills #216.)*
- **A mechanism does not have to be named after a project to be that project's.** A portability sweep for
  project names could never catch `lib/flags.ts` / `DEFAULT_FLAGS`. Generic filenames are how one
  consumer's architecture ships to everyone — and when a new rule surfaces incidental matches, **rewrite
  them rather than allowlisting them**; an ALLOW entry preserves residue behind a plausible reason.
- **Verify a dependency's runtime claim by EXECUTING it, not by reading it.** Running a published package
  inside a `node:vm` context carrying only the target runtime's globals answered "is this Edge-safe" in
  two halves — the API surface is, the *lifecycle* is not — where reading the source would have given only
  the first, which is precisely the half that gets a seam planned that cannot work. Ship the reproduction
  beside the claim so it can be re-checked instead of going quietly stale.
- **Refuse the flag that blurs a fail-soft promise.** A `--strict` that turns "the provider is unreachable"
  into a failure will be in someone's CI file within the week, and the promise is then gone with nobody
  having decided to give it up. Not adding it is the enforcement.
- **A "harmless default" handed to someone else's API is not harmless — read what the callee does
  with the field.** Defaulting an unset `environment` to `'development'` looked like courtesy; in the
  SDK that field is a hard ASSERTION, and a snapshot that disagrees is rejected. A valid production
  credential then served compile-time defaults permanently and silently, indistinguishable from an
  outage. **When a value is unknown, omit it and let the source of truth establish it** — and say
  out loud that nobody asserted it.
- **"The package is not installed" is the most complete outage there is — import dynamically and test in
  it.** A seam whose SDK is loaded with `await import()` has its entire fallback contract exercised in a
  checkout with no `node_modules`: no network, no credentials, no transport to mock.
- **Creating a thing and activating it are different verbs, and no dashboard tells you which you did.**
  Definitions synced but never activated reads as "the flags exist" while the runtime serves compile
  defaults. The fix is not a paragraph — it is the verification command, in the story template, as its
  own step.

### Deriving state from docs (build-visualization-claude-mods, 2026-09-19)
*If a tool answers "what is being built right now" — a status line, a board, a report.*

- **A resolver that names the work in flight attracts exactly one class of bug: the plausible wrong
  answer.** Every one of the nine review findings on `build-state.mjs` was one — a stacked `-s4` branch
  inheriting the previous sprint's commits, a shared session journal holding another epic's entries,
  `feat/aws-s3` parsed as sprint 3 of `aws`, a stale `origin/main` putting main's commits inside
  `base..HEAD`. **Scope every input explicitly (this epic, this sprint) and return `unknown`**; an
  unknown is a correct answer, a confident wrong one destroys the tool's only asset. *(2026-09-19)*
- **Mutation-check the TEST, not only the code.** A fix for the stale-base bug passed its brand-new test
  while still being wrong — both merge-bases shared a commit timestamp, so the date comparison never
  fired. Flipping the code and watching the test *fail* is what exposed it; ancestry replaced the clock.
  A test that passes for the wrong reason is worse than no test. *(2026-09-19)*
- **Make the machine-readable field a NEW key rather than overloading a live one.** The executive ladder
  went into `phase:`, not `status:`: the epic `status:` is the board's SSOT and an unknown value hard-
  fails the extractor, and on a sprint file a frontmatter `status:` would have been captured by the
  extractor's own `^Status:` regex — silently re-deriving every sprint on the board. *(2026-09-19)*
- **A mechanical migration must not be gated on unrelated pre-existing findings.** A doc checker that
  blocks on *every* finding in a touched file turns "add frontmatter to 539 legacy docs" into "sweep 251
  unrelated findings, or bypass the hook". Gate on what the commit **introduces** (compare against
  `HEAD`), which is the same "green on today's known state, red on anything new" rule those checkers are
  always written with. *(2026-09-19)*
- **Backfill and rail-sync belong in ONE PR per consumer.** Landing the checker first makes every later
  doc commit fail its pre-commit hook until the backfill arrives. *(2026-09-19)*

### Probing an undocumented, pre-release API (build-visualization-claude-mods, 2026-09-19)

- **The loop is: a validator for the shape, a real session plus the debug log for the runtime.**
  `claude plugin validate` gives the manifest schema and lists a module's hooks and `$` calls, but it
  accepts calls that do not exist; only a live run (`claude -p --plugin-dir <dir> --debug`, then
  `~/.claude/debug/latest`) tells you the truth. Four probe rounds taught: `{"modules": ["./index.ts"]}`,
  `register(on)`, hooks are `($, e, next)` and must call **`next(e)`**, `$` may only ever appear as
  `$.noun.event(...)` at a call site, and a module may import only its own relative files. *(2026-09-19)*
- **Pin the CLI version in the check that validates against it.** The first unpinned CI install failed on
  a schema the probed version does not have (`hooks: Invalid input: expected record`). Same discipline as
  the cross-review families' pinned CLIs — bump deliberately, after re-probing. *(2026-09-19)*
  **A pin can also pin you BELOW your own code** (live-build-view, 2026-10-03): CI stayed on 2.1.278, which has no
  `$.state`, for two epics after the mod started using it, because nothing failed loudly. Bump the pin in the same PR
  that first uses a newer noun.
- **A fixture written from memory of the API is a second, wrong API.** `claude plugin test` and a real
  `--debug-file` session are the only judges: the spec fixture said `kind: 'directory'` (the engine says `'dir'`, and
  reports `mtimeMs: 0` for directories), and an event's answer was wrapped in `{ value }` like an op's (an event answers
  bare: `{ isFilled }`). Every node spec stayed green; one headless run walked 12 entries instead of 535.
  *(live-build-view, 2026-10-03)*
- **`$` may be passed to a function declared at the TOP of the module** (`function ioFor($: EngineInterface)`), not
  to a nested const — the validator says exactly this. That is how one I/O object serves `session.start`, `turn.start`
  and a timer, and how the orchestration moves into a pure, `node --test`-able module. *(live-build-view, 2026-10-03)*

### A model as a guard's judge (jev-semantic-guards, 2026-09-23)

- **Measure what you SEND as well as what you ask, on real history.** semantic-lint first sent whole diff hunks; a
  new file is one hunk, so 33 of 60 real candidates from 220 commits were over the size limit and would have been
  "not checked" — invisible on constructed fixtures, which are all small. A ±15-line window around each hit: 3 of 40.
  And re-asking identical text moves p by up to 0.04, so don't fit a threshold to one recording. *(semantic-lint, 2026-09-30)*
- **Labels for a rule that is project DATA are project data too.** Shipping this repo's rule fixtures in the template's
  shared fixtures file would have failed any consumer that reused the id, and — once coverage was per configured rule —
  every consumer that added one. Skipping fixtures for an unknown rule was worse: a renamed rule replayed green with
  zero cases scored. Unknown-rule fixtures FAIL; coverage counts what is scored, not what is committed. *(semantic-lint, 2026-09-30)*
- **Measure the question before trusting the model. The first wording is a guess.** Every first question
  underperformed the regex it was replacing, or barely beat it: a real review scored 0.73, and liveness
  scored 48/62. Keep a labelled fixture set **with recorded answers**. Then wording and thresholds become an
  offline sweep over identical answers instead of an argument, and CI replays the recordings, so a model
  bump or threshold change goes red instead of silently changing verdicts. *(2026-09-23)*
- **Three states, never two: "could not look" is its own outcome.** No key, a 429, a timeout or a malformed
  answer (`"1"`, `true`, `null`) must fall back to the deterministic rule and **say so in the reason**. A
  coerced `Number(true)` became a model-decided PASS until review caught it. Only a probability in [0,1]
  counts as a verdict. *(2026-09-23)*
  **A list is the same shape:** a failed `gh pr list` that leaves `[]` reads as "0 pull requests, nothing shipped".
  Put every external list through ONE reader that names what it could not read (and uses limit + 1 to say when a list
  was cut), and have the write refuse while any list is unread. first-run-setup's issues had the check; its pull
  requests didn't, and two reviewers found the two halves. *(2026-10-07)*
- **A shadow period can run on history, if the history is decision-shaped.** Replaying 655 posted reviews
  and 186 retrospectives through the same judge in shadow did in minutes what a calendar shadow does in
  weeks. Name the corpus bias (posted = accepted) and label the other direction on purpose. *(2026-09-23)*
- **After a flip, the audit trail must keep the old decider's verdict.** Once the model decides, "posted"
  no longer means "the old rule accepted it". A marker without the regex's own verdict makes the monitoring
  report blind to the model's false passes, the one thing it exists to watch. *(2026-09-23)*
- **Evidence tooling fails closed too.** An empty log, a `{}` line, a marker with no mode, or a forged
  comment from a stranger on a public repo must never count as evidence. Filter by author provenance and
  exit non-zero on nothing. *(2026-09-23)*

### Locking against the live system (think-skills, 2026-10-01)

- **Check which credential a route accepts before planning a client over it.** The plan was "a `gf` command over the
  existing North Star route, with the existing `gf` key". The CLI holds a personal token that only `/api/v1/cli/*`
  accepts, and the route takes only a project ingest key, so the headline story would have 401'd. Reading two auth
  functions at the lock disproved it before any code was written.
- **"Sync replaces" is a claim to check against the upsert's conflict key.** `onConflict: 'project_id,key'` means a
  new key ADDS a row beside the old one and an existing child key MOVES. A dry run should name those effects, because
  syncing again can't undo them.
- **A kill switch must come before the request BODY, not only before the credential.** All three CLI POST routes
  parsed JSON first, so with the gate OFF a malformed body answered 400 instead of the uniform 404. When the test
  server can't turn the gate off, pin the order structurally: no route reads a body itself, and the one reader
  checks the gate first.

### Publishing a package and a plugin (golden-frijoles-plugin, 2026-09-23)

- **npm trusted publishing has three npm-side gates, and the log names none of them clearly.**
  1. A trusted publisher can only be attached to a package that already exists (a deprecated `0.0.0` bootstrap
     by hand).
  2. A 404 on `PUT` means no publisher matched.
  3. A 403 "OIDC permission denied for this action" *after* `oidc Successfully retrieved and set token` means the
     publisher's **Allowed actions** is stage-only. A direct publish then returns **202** and appears minutes
     later, after asynchronous validation.
  **Run `npm publish --loglevel verbose` before theorising.** The first theory here (setup-node's
  `registry-url`) was wrong, and the verbose log disproved it in one run.
- **A CLI's output can depend on whether it thinks an agent is running it.** `npx skills` prints plain names in an
  agent session and ANSI-coloured ones in CI, so a check was green locally and red on GitHub. Prove a check that
  parses a tool's output under `env -i PATH=… HOME=<tmp> CI=true`, not inside the session that wrote it.
- **A required check must not depend on the PR having merged.** A probe of the *published* repo can never pass on
  the PR that adds what it probes. Run it against the PR's own tree, and keep a `--live` mode for the post-merge
  record.
- **Migrating a consumer onto a shared package: byte parity is necessary, output parity decides.** An unmodified
  copy can still behave differently through the package when it calls a sibling the consumer has forked. Diff each
  moved command's before/after output. It kept one skill local that byte parity would have moved.
- **Automatic behaviour must not run repo-supplied code.** "The project's own `scripts/<x>` wins" suits a command
  the user explicitly invokes. First-contact detection and setup call the trusted package directly: `init.mjs`
  and `preflight.mjs` are names a stranger's repo can own. **The build-view hook violated this for weeks,
  running `<repo>/scripts/build-state.mjs` on every turn**, and it was found only by a lock that read the
  hook. The fix is a byte-checked bundle inside the plugin, located from the module's own `import.meta.url`
  (probed live), and always used. *(2026-09-29)*
- **`$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is not set in a skill's shell** (measured, Claude Code 2.1.280). Locate a skill from its
  own base directory, which the host shows when the skill is invoked.
- **A local runner that mirrors CI must sandbox CI's global installs.** One `npm i -g <pinned CLI>` step, run
  locally, downgraded the operator's own tool. Point `NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX` at a temp dir and prepend its `bin/`.

### Layering config and depending on a fresh release (golden-frijoles-plugin wave 2, 2026-09-24)

- **A new config file over old ones reopens every "absent means default" rule.** Wave 1's `egress` defaulted to
  `true` when missing. Wave 2 made a `null` in the new file mean "unset", so the merge dropped it and the rail read
  `true` again: a stranger's text was sent with nobody's yes. Decide the absent case at the LOADER, and spec the
  merge path, not just the parser.
- **A version minutes old on npm can still 404.** `npm view` listed kit 0.4.0 while the tarball 404'd in Vercel's
  install. Wait for the tarball URL to return 200 before a consumer depends on it. A re-run fixes it, not a code
  change.
- **A release guard must cover everything the package ships, not only its code.** `check-release` counted `plugins/**`,
  `kit/**` and the script closure, but not the Roadmap skeleton `gf-kit init` writes. An edit to the template's
  WAYS-OF-WORKING would have merged without the release that publishes it. When a package gains a new kind of
  payload, add it to the guard's surface in the same change, derived from the same list the builder reads (`SKELETON`).
  And a closure check sees only imports: a file that is *read* (a template) needs a packed-tarball spec.
  *(2026-10-04, kickoff-generator-path.)*
- **Copy the shared rails into a consumer before calling the wave done.** The consumers' own lint, Prettier and
  reviews found five defects the source repo's gates couldn't see. The copy-in is a gate, not a chore.

### Reviewing a security guard, and reviewing through a partial lens (distribute-what-we-use, 2026-09-29)

- **A security guard's review converges on the guard.** #188 took 7 fresh rounds. From round 4 on, each round
  found one small defect in the *new* secret guard, introduced by the previous round's fix. The stop signal is
  a clean round, not a count. The residual no code can close (a reviewer that can read the host can be told to
  encode what it reads) is a risk-acceptance question for the product owner, asked once, with a recommendation.
- **A reviewer's output is a publishing path, and so is everything that quotes it.** The secret guard ran before
  the comment post but *after* the output guard, whose failing status quoted the reply's first line into a
  PUBLIC commit status. Put the egress check where the text first leaves the process, not where you think it's
  posted.
- **A `--paths`-scoped external pass files findings about what it didn't see.** agy's scoped pass on #189 called
  committed files "missing" (one Blocking, two Should-fix). Verify every finding against the tree, and state
  each scoped pass's coverage exactly: an overclaimed coverage line was itself a review finding.
- **Retargeting a PR's base does not trigger CI.** After squash-merging the base of a stack, force-push the
  child (or push a commit), or the PR reads green with no run on its head.

### Formal verification on our own code (verify-spike, 2026-09-29)

- **A proof verifies the model, not the code.** Ship a proof tier only with a differential test
  against the real implementation. A Lean model that used Lean's own whitespace rule where the code
  uses JS `trim()` disagreed with production on 8% of inputs, and every theorem still held.
- **Random simulation and bounded exhaustive search find different bugs. Run both.** Quint's simulator
  found a stranded row in 1 s and never found the 12-step unbounded-resend trace that Apalache found in
  about 2 minutes. Use simulation per PR (fast) and exhaustive search nightly (slow).
- **`git show <merge-commit>` prints a combined diff, which is empty for a clean merge.** Anything that
  feeds "what did this PR change" to a model or reviewer must diff against the first parent
  (`git diff <sha>^1 <sha>`). Two of nine PRs sent Jev no code before this was caught.
- **In zsh, `set -- $spec` and `$PATHS` do not word-split.** A loop over "module invariant depth"
  strings ran nine model checks with empty arguments and printed nine blank results that looked
  like output. Put such loops in a `bash` script, which the reproduce doc needs anyway. The same trap bit
  `git add $FILES` in `intent-match` (2026-09-30): use `${=FILES}` or an array (`(${(f)"$(…)"})`).
- **A backticked commit message in double quotes is a zsh parse error, or worse, command substitution.**
  (`intent-match`, 2026-09-30.) Commit and PR bodies go through a quoted heredoc (`-F - <<'EOF'`), always.

### Measuring a question's wording (compiled-prompts, 2026-09-30)

- **Held-out folds guard against fitting, not against an author who read the folds.** A candidate wording passed
  the rule (+5 held out, no worse fold) because its examples were copied from the drafts it then fixed: 9 of 10
  fixes. Write candidates against drafts you haven't read, and read the per-draft flips, not the total. The flips
  are where the real rule shows up.
- **To prove a data move changed nothing, pin the old values first, then move.** Stamping recordings from the
  pre-move constants turned "byte-identical" into a check that goes red on one changed character.
- **A cache of paid answers must key on everything an answer depends on:** the wording, the model, the input text,
  and survival of a throwing client. Review found these one per round across four rounds.
- **A template comment that names a heading becomes an edit anchor.** "belongs in ## Why" inside an HTML comment
  sent the fill-in edit into the comment and hid the section in four epics. Never name the literal anchor text in a
  scaffold's comments.

### Scoring a plan against its ask (intent-match, 2026-09-30)

- **Change what a guard counts and its limit in the same commit.** Excluding a forced declaration list from the groom
  SKILL.md line budget was right; leaving the limit at 220 while the measure fell by 10 handed out 10 lines, and the
  next sprint used exactly those ten. The fresh reviewer caught it. A guard corrected is one whose strength is equal
  before and after, measured on `main`.
- **Model output written into a document must be inert.** A reader's reply carried its own `## ` headings and fences;
  a re-run ended the section early and stacked a stale copy in a README, while the walkthrough said "replaced". Indent
  it (never fence it), use CommonMark's fence rule (0–3 spaces) in every scanner, and run the secret guard before the
  text leaves the process — to a model or to a public file.
- **An unanchored ignore rule hides new files in every folder of that name.** `references/`, meant for one local-only
  folder, silently hid a new skill reference. Run `git check-ignore -v <new file>` when a new file "didn't show up".
- **A score needs the ask, and old plans rarely kept it.** Only 12 of 63 shipped medusa-bonsai seeds carry a
  recoverable ask (a Problem section or a mirror-back); the rest open with status blocks. Store the ask verbatim from
  now on; a proxy ask is flagged, never mixed in silently.
- **Regenerate the board with every sprint's doc commit.** The pre-push hook refused two pushes because a plan or
  tick commit left `BUILD-ORDER.md` stale.

### Measuring agent spend from transcripts (finops, 2026-10-03)

- **A transcript's `gitBranch` is the branch of the session's own checkout, not of the work.** A session sitting on
  `feat/semantic-lint` that built `intent-match` in another directory stamped every turn with the wrong epic. Build an
  epic from a session on its branch, or in a worktree on it — and attribute by branch, never guess.
- **Count a streamed message once, by `message.id`, at its LARGEST `output_tokens`; let the FIRST occurrence own the
  attribution.** Claude Code writes one entry per content block (half the entries are repeats), and a resumed session
  copies earlier entries into a new file re-stamped with the new branch.
- **When a checkout moves, its transcripts keep the old `cwd`.** The project folder Claude Code keeps is the reliable
  signal. Its 30-day cleanup runs silently, so an index that keeps aggregates must exist BEFORE the history you want.
- **After a copy change, run the full api suite and the authed project, not the specs you think it touches.** A
  vocabulary spec pinned a sentence the FinOps rewrite removed, and the visual gate needed a way to reach the new
  page; a focused run caught neither, CI caught both, one round apart.
- **A merged stack squashed into `main` conflicts on every shared file.** Check that `main`'s tree equals the parent's
  final tree (`git diff --stat origin/main <parent>` is empty) — then "ours" is provably right and the merge changes
  nothing.


### A frozen page after a Server Action, and the Next 16 upgrade (portfolio-loop-flake, 2026-10-04)

- **A Server Action that writes, answers in full, and leaves the page unchanged forever is a lost React ping, not a
  slow test.** Next ≤16.2 vendors a React that drops the wake-up when a transition suspends on a Flight chunk already in
  `resolved_model` (vercel/next.js#98303); every chunk ends `fulfilled` and nothing re-renders. It only shows on a busy
  CPU: reproduce with CDP `Emulation.setCPUThrottlingRate` 6× on a production build, not by adding waits. Fixed by Next
  16.3. The tell in a trace: the action's response is complete, and no `_rsc` GET or `pushState` follows it.
- **Read the response before blaming the server.** Byte-identical action bodies in passing and failing runs ruled the
  server out in one comparison; days of hydration waits had been aimed at the wrong side.
- **Next 16 minifies CSS with Lightning CSS, which keeps ONE of `prop` / `-webkit-prop`: the last one written.** Our
  hand-written `-webkit-backdrop-filter` after `backdrop-filter` shipped only the prefixed one, which Chromium ignores,
  and the glass material vanished. Never hand-prefix; the minifier adds prefixes. It also respells values (`0ms` → `0s`,
  `160ms` → `.16s`), so assert the meaning of a token, not its spelling.
- **Baseline a red suite against `main` on the same database before calling it a regression.** Eleven api failures
  (`URI too long` from PostgREST) were local DB state: identical on Next 15.

### A credential that gains power, and the claims around it (account-from-the-terminal, 2026-10-06)

- **When a credential gains power, every place that DISPLAYS it is re-classified — including files you never
  touched.** Making the connector URL write as its maker turned the onboarding page's long-standing "show the URL
  to any member" into a way for a member to copy an owner's write credential. Neither external pass saw it: the file
  was outside the diff. Before merging a capability change, grep every renderer of the credential, not the diff.
  **The same holds for every place it is MINTED (connect-page, 2026-10-06):** the owner stamp went on the Create button
  but not on signup provisioning, the other mint path, so every new account got a read-only URL. List the mint paths
  as well as the renderers.
- **"Read-only" is a claim that rots when write paths are added elsewhere.** `llms.txt` said the connector was
  read-only for weeks after task and flag writes shipped over it; the first correction overclaimed the other way
  ("the only thing it can change is…"). State the boundary as the list of write paths and the credential each
  needs, and point the guard at that list — a guard on a summary sentence pins whatever the summary got wrong.
- **A trust page is a set of checkable claims about OTHER people's tools.** `install.md` was wrong three times
  (a third-party CLI's own telemetry, writes into `~/.claude`, a revoke link that 404'd). A test can hold the page
  to its own list of hosts; only reading the tools themselves (the npx cache, `--help`, the route table) checks the
  list is complete.
- **Supabase silently falls back to its Site URL when `redirectTo` isn't allow-listed.** The symptom — `?code=` on an
  old domain, every later visit following it — points away from the cause. Check Authentication › URL Configuration
  (Site URL AND Redirect URLs, with `/**`) before debugging the callback.
- **When a gate's ON state matches production, its "connector on, writes off" state may exist on NO test server.**
  Turning `CONNECTOR_WRITES_ENABLED` on in CI (correctly: production has it on) left the dark branch untested, and the
  OFF server turns the whole connector off. Pin that branch with a unit test on the rule plus a structural check on
  the route, and say so where the gate is set.
- **A structural design contract can be satisfied by a different page (connect-page, 2026-10-06).** `setup-connect`
  measures block sequence, so a reordered page with the same skeleton still "matches". When contents move under an
  unchanged contract, say so where the row is pinned and put the re-approval to the product owner — a green gate is
  not an approval of the new picture.

### Renaming on screen, and the guards around it (one-header-one-name, 2026-10-07)
- **Rename the label, never the key, and assert both.** The board's stage names are stored values; renaming
  `'To groom'` would have emptied a column silently. Route every display through one label function, keep the key in a
  `data-` attribute, and have the spec assert the label and the key side by side, so neither can drift unseen.
- **A source-scanning word guard has a shape; pin its blind spots as tests.** A regex over source can't see text
  assembled at runtime, attribute strings or template literals. Recording each miss as an asserted `null` in the
  guard's self-test makes widening it a decision rather than a discovery.
- **A fallback that only some viewers see needs a blocking-gate test per viewer class.** The demo Hub's tab row (for
  an anonymous visitor and a signed-in non-member) was first tested only in the browser project, which CI doesn't run.
- **Format the files you edited, by name — never a glob or `git diff --name-only`.** Twice in one sprint a broad
  `prettier --write` dragged 22 untouched specs into the diff, the second time re-formatting files just restored
  (a restore makes them "changed"). The bloated diff pushed the PR past agy's input budget and its first review was
  empty.
- **Grep the mutated file before trusting a green mutation run.** The first "put the old name back" mutation edited
  nothing (prettier had reflowed the line), and the guard's green meant nothing. The same holds for any scripted edit: a
  find-and-replace on a file prettier has reflowed silently misses — make the script assert its pattern matched
  (result-record hit it four times; the asserts caught each, and one unasserted edit left an unused import for lint).

### One page per epic (one-epic-page, 2026-10-07)
- **Paste a generated instruction into an agent; don't infer how it will be read.** Eight plain-line commands began
  with their shorthand's verb and all "obviously" mapped; one ("Resume building the … epic") was read as Build epic
  because of the second verb. A read-only trial (`claude -p --permission-mode plan "…say which step; don't do it"`)
  costs cents and is the only evidence the acceptance asked for.
- **A fixture missing a field hides the branch that keys off it.** "No target yet" passed only because the fixture seed
  had no goal; 9 of 13 real seeds have one. Seed one fixture row WITH every optional field the view branches on.
- **Two prettier configs must both accept a file a parity check needs byte-identical.** Format with the root's, copy,
  then `prettier --check` it from `skills/` — otherwise parity and `format:changed` fight each other.

### Text a person decides on is an interface (gates-in-plain-agile, 2026-10-07)
- **Review a gate's wording the way you'd review an API.** Four rounds on #302 found ambiguities, not style: a kill switch
  shown as "off", "not installed" for a signed-out gh, no "nothing missing" variant, and decisions and options both
  numbered, so a reply of "1" meant two things. Letter the questions and number the options.
- **A word guard may skip placeholders but not alternatives.** `<on | off>` reaches the screen; `<placeholder>` does not.
  Blanking every `<…>` let "Fund it first" through inside an alternative.
- **Read the design source before the lock, and correct what it promises out loud.** The canvas drew a flag created at
  grooming, an email digest and one-pagers that don't exist. Each became a named lock correction, not a review finding.

### Expected against actual on one report (outcome-report-v2, 2026-10-07)
- **A tolerance in a lock is a number with a unit.** "On pace within 5%, min 0.5" made every 0–1 rate "on pace" forever
  (0.01 against an expected 0.20). Scale any threshold to the metric it judges and to the move that was planned.
- **A lens is an audience, not a session.** The `team` lens also serves the anonymous demo report, so lens-gated links
  still reached signed-out readers. Gate what needs a sign-in on the session; gate what an audience may see on the lens.
- **Give each optional half of a page its own try.** A tenant-pushed `2026-13-01` passed the shape regex, threw in
  `toISOString()`, and through an un-guarded `Promise.all` arm took down the report and every share link. Validate the
  calendar, and let a half that can fail cost only itself (`unavailable`), never the page.

### Recording a result per epic (result-record, 2026-10-07)
- **A zero-dependency file stays zero-dependency, even for a sibling import.** `roadmap-contract.mjs` importing a new
  `lib/result-dates.mjs` broke every consumer that copies the contract alone (the pre-commit fixture, copy-once
  projects). Invert the import: the shared primitive lives in the dependency-free file, the new module imports it.
- **Let the live data set the default, not the rule's text.** "Read 30 days after shipping" applied literally would
  have raised 54 "read due" lines on day one for epics shipped before the record existed. A derived default applies
  only to rows that opted in (an epic with a target).
- **Answer a reviewer's repeated false positive with a spec, not a second comment.** Codex twice read the reads-due
  check as never seeing the derived date; a spec building the row through the extract's own function settled it and
  now guards the path.
- **A grooming no-go that blocks the feature's core claim is a question for the product owner, not a scope
  correction.** "No new API" made the lock ship `epic-read` with the owner typing the number — the opposite of the value
  proposition ("the agent fetches it") — and cost a third sprint after the close. The lock disproves scope out loud;
  when what it would cut is the point of the feature, it asks.
- **An unbounded PostgREST select is a silent sample past `max_rows`.** The telemetry series read had no `.range()` or
  order, so past 1,000 events it summed an arbitrary subset. Page in a stable order and refuse past a hard bound;
  never return a partial aggregate as if it were whole.
- **A "half" value the contract accepts is a silent failure downstream.** From/to with no metric passed validation
  and then never came due, because every reader keyed off the metric. When readers agree on what makes a record
  "complete", the contract must refuse anything less.
