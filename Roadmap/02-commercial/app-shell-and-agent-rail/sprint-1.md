# App shell and agent rail — Sprint 1: The read seam and the shell

**Status:** ✅ complete — `b9ff9d6` (1.1) · `14fd94c` (1.2) · `49cd746` (1.3) · `06a2031` (1.4) · `9bcef1f` (QA)

> **Build contract (locked by the architect before the builder started).** Cite the epic README's
> decisions; do not re-derive them. Binding here: **D1** (render `PROJECT_ROUTE_INVENTORY`, never a
> second list), **D2** (allow-listed actions, never `select *`), **D3** (`metadata.via` for
> attribution, never an actor string), **D7** (use `Icon`; do not weaken the drift guard),
> **D10** (order by `created_at`, never `id`).
>
> **This is the shared-surface sprint — architect, first, not delegated.** Two new `lib/` seams and
> a guard change; every later branch inherits them (LEARNINGS: do the shared-surface work yourself
> and first).
>
> **Tenancy is the risk in this sprint, not the UI.** Both new reads take a **required** `projectId`
> resolved server-side via `lib/membership.ts` / `lib/dashboard-auth.ts`. There is no cross-project
> variant of either function, and none may be added. AGENTS: no request-derived read path may cross
> projects. **No migration** — both tables already exist.

## Stories

### Story 1.1 — `lib/agent-activity.ts`, the project-scoped activity read
**As a** PM, **I want** the engine to be able to tell me what happened on my project recently,
**so that** the rail in Sprint 2 has something true to show.
**Acceptance:** given two projects with audit rows, a read for project A returns only A's rows,
newest first; each row carries an actor (agent or human) derived from `metadata.via`; an action
outside the allow-list is not returned even though it exists in the table.
**Risk:** high
**Notes:** model on `lib/task-lifecycle-facts.ts` — same shape, same tenancy discipline. Return
`null`, not `[]`, when the read fails, so "we couldn't look" stays distinguishable from "nothing
happened" (the `not_instrumented` vs `not_met` distinction this repo already draws). The index
`audit_log_project_created_idx (project_id, created_at DESC)` already backs the query.

### Story 1.2 — `lib/pending-confirmations.ts`, the staged-proposal read
**As a** PM, **I want** the engine to know which agent proposals are waiting on me, **so that** the
rail can surface them instead of leaving them invisible until someone reads the database.
**Acceptance:** returns only unspent, unexpired confirmations for the given project; a confirmation
minted under project A is absent from project B's read; each row carries the task, the action
(`claim`/`resolve`/`dismiss`) and the frozen parameters, not a re-derived preview.
**Risk:** high
**Notes:** read-only. **This story must not call `consume_write_confirmation`** — spending is the
agent's path, not the dashboard's. Per D8 the result is task-scoped; that is what the table models.

### Story 1.3 — the section nav
**As a** PM, **I want** to reach and relate every feature area from the shell, **so that** I stop
needing to know URLs.
**Acceptance:** every surface in `PROJECT_ROUTE_INVENTORY` the signed-in user is entitled to is
reachable from the header on desktop and from the existing narrow-width pattern on mobile; a gated
surface is presented per its `status` rather than 404ing; no route list is hardcoded in the shell.
**Risk:** low
**Notes:** `ProductShell.tsx` currently ships three links plus a static "Engine ready" pill. Keep the
mobile bottom-tab instinct and extend it with an overflow. `AGENT_RAIL_ENABLED` does **not** gate
this (D6).

### Story 1.4 — extend the drift guard to the component directories
**As a** builder, **I want** the design-drift guard to cover the directories the new primitives land
in, **so that** Sprint 2 can't introduce raw hex or pictographs where nothing is watching.
**Acceptance:** `npm run check:design-drift` walks `apps/web/components/ui` and
`apps/web/components/product` in addition to today's roots; the existing suite still passes; a
deliberately-introduced `#ff0000` in a `components/ui` file fails the guard.
**Risk:** low
**Notes:** keep the inline-style rule landing-only — `/app` needs dynamic bar widths in S3.

## Sprint QA
- **api spec(s):** 1.1 + 1.2 → one new `e2e/agent-activity.spec.ts` asserting the cross-project
  isolation directly (two projects, one read, assert the other's rows are absent). 1.4 → covered by
  `scripts/check-design-drift.test.mjs`.
- **browser smoke owed:** no — 1.3 is anonymous-testable via the existing
  `project-navigation.authed.spec.ts` pattern; no money or auth step in this sprint.
- **deterministic gate:** `npm run typecheck` + `npm run lint` + `npm run test:unit` +
  `npm run build` + `npm run test:e2e` + `npm run check:design-drift`, green before merge. Invoke
  CI's own npm scripts, never a hand-written subset (LEARNINGS: a local gate that is a subset of
  CI's produces a green that doesn't mean what CI means).
- **mutation check:** the isolation spec must be observed failing — drop the `project_id` filter,
  confirm red, revert, re-verify clean. A spec that can't fail is worse than no spec.

## Sprint 1 — Smoke walkthrough (do these in order)
Env: the branch preview (pre-merge) · production `https://goldenfrijoles.com` once merged

1. Sign in and go to `/app`.
   → The header shows the full section nav, not just *Projects · Connect · Agent notes*.
2. From the header, open each feature area for a project you belong to.
   → Every one resolves; none 404s; a flag-gated surface reads as gated rather than broken.
3. Narrow the window to a phone width (or open on a phone).
   → Navigation is still usable — the bottom-tab pattern with an overflow, no horizontal scroll.
4. Sign in as a user who belongs to a different project and open `/app`.
   → You see only your own projects, and nothing referencing the other tenant.

If any step fails, note the step number + what you saw — that's the bug report.

## Sprint 1 — what actually happened

**Both new seams are TWO modules, not one.** `lib/agent-activity.ts` and
`lib/pending-confirmations.ts` are `server-only` wrappers over
`*-read.ts` modules that take their Supabase client as a parameter. That was not the plan; it is
what the QA requirement forced, and it turned out to be the right shape. A `server-only` import
throws in plain Node, so a Playwright spec cannot reach those modules — and a spec that
re-implemented the query to check tenancy would prove nothing about the query the product runs. The
split lets `e2e/agent-activity.spec.ts` exercise the REAL function against two real tenants. Same
arrangement, same reason, as `task-lifecycle-facts.ts` + `task-lifecycle-count.ts`.

**Mutation check, both directions** (the sprint asked for one): dropping
`.eq('project_id', projectId)` from `readAgentActivity` turns 3 specs red; dropping it from
`readPendingConfirmations` turns 2 red. Restored, re-verified 6/6 green.

**`agentKeyId` is NOT NULL, not nullable.** The plan assumed it could be null (the original
migration's `ON DELETE SET NULL` comment says so). Migration `20260806140000` made it NOT NULL after
a Codex finding — so the type is non-nullable and no UI can grow a "proposed by nobody" branch.

**The section nav is a `<details>` disclosure at both widths, not an inline row on desktop.**
Revealing a closed `<details>`' content with CSS is not reliable across engines (the content lives
in an unassigned shadow slot), and rendering the list twice to work around that would read every
section name twice to a screen reader. Stated here because the sprint brief implied an inline row.

**Diff-size note:** `format:changed` reformats any file a change touches, and several `/app` pages
carried pre-existing Prettier drift. Adding one `projectSlug` prop reformatted them whole. The
functional change to each is one line.

**Gate, in CI's order:** `format:changed` · `lint` · `typecheck` (4 tsconfigs) · `test:unit` (869) ·
`build` · `check:design-drift` (67 files) · Playwright `api` **431 passed / 36 skipped / 0 failed**.
