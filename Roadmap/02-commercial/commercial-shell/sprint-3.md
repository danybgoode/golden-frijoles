# Commercial shell — Sprint 3: Launch & dogfood

**Status:** ✅ Done (2026-07-20) — Stories 3.1 + 3.2 merged to `main` ([PR #11](https://github.com/danybgoode/golden-beans/pull/11), squash `7b24502`); Story 3.3 launch executed the same day (self-tracking project seeded in prod, demo connector token minted, `CONNECTOR_ENABLED` flipped ON). Domain: staying on the Vercel deployment host (`golden-beans-gamma`) for v1 (Daniel's call, zero-cost outcome). Announce: owner-owned.

## Stories

### Story 3.1 — Dogfood instrumentation ✅
**As the** team, **I want** the landing instrumented by the engine itself (`golden-beans` as its
own tenant: visitor → waitlist TARS funnel via the real SDK), **so that** we sell what we use and
the epic's Grower signal is measurable.
**Acceptance:** a real visitor→waitlist funnel renders in the engine; the Grower signal (waitlist
conversion rate) is defined in the registry; landing traffic never mixes into the demo or Miyagi
projects.
**Risk:** LOW
**Build note:** the landing now dogfoods the engine as a THIRD tenant (`golden-beans`, separate
from `golden-beans-demo` and Miyagi), through the real `@golden-beans/sdk` — no parallel pipeline
(AGENTS.md rule #1). New `lib/self-track.ts` wraps `createGrowthEngineClient` (baseUrl `getSiteUrl()`,
key from `SELF_PROJECT_API_KEY`); it is **total** — no key ⇒ clean no-op, SDK errors swallowed+logged,
never throws into the request path or blocks the response (CI's `typecheck-build` runs with zero
Supabase env). Funnel identity is a `gb_vid` visitor cookie: since a Server Component can't set
cookies, the entry event fires from a new Route Handler `POST /api/v1/public/self-visit` (mints the
cookie, fires `landing_visited`), driven by an invisible client beacon `SelfTrackBeacon` on `/`; the
conversion `waitlist_joined` is fired from the existing waitlist route's **successful, non-honeypot**
insert path under the SAME cookie (the honeypot's silent-success returns before it, so a bot never
counts). Grower signal registered via a real `POST /api/v1/features/sync`: `waitlist_conversion`
(`landing_visited` → `waitlist_joined`) by new idempotent `scripts/seed-self-project.mjs`
(`npm run seed:self`), sibling to the demo seeder — project row = direct upsert, signal = real API;
it refuses to run if `SELF_PROJECT_SLUG === DEMO_PROJECT_SLUG`. Isolation is structural (tenant
resolved from the Bearer key server-side, never a slug/body field) and asserted in
`e2e/self-track.spec.ts`. Env vars for prod (owed to the integrating session): **`SELF_PROJECT_SLUG`**
(optional, default `golden-beans`) and **`SELF_PROJECT_API_KEY`** (from the seed script's printout).
**Verify gap:** `tsc --noEmit` + `npm run build` clean; the Playwright `api` project (incl. this
spec) could NOT be run here — Docker/local Supabase was unavailable in the worktree — so the e2e
gate + a real red run are owed; the spec's mutation check (removing self-track's no-op guard ⇒ 500s
⇒ first two tests red) is reasoned, not observed. Commit `c029622`.

### Story 3.2 — SEO/OG + agent-readable manifest ✅
**As a** searcher (human or agent), **I want** correct meta/OG unfurls and an `llms.txt`-style
manifest listing the public routes and connector docs, **so that** both audiences parse the offer.
**Acceptance:** link unfurls with a correct card in a chat app; manifest served and accurate.
**Risk:** LOW
**Build note:** used Next's file-based `opengraph-image.tsx`/`twitter-image.tsx` convention
(`next/og`'s `ImageResponse`, shared JSX in `lib/og-image-content.tsx`) instead of hand-building
`<meta>` tags — no design asset exists in this repo yet (no `apps/web/public/` dir), and the
convention wires up `og:image:width/height/type` automatically. `app/layout.tsx`'s `metadata`
export became an async `generateMetadata()` (not a static object) specifically so `openGraph.url`/
`metadataBase` call `getSiteUrl()` live per request instead of baking in whatever `SITE_URL` (or
none) happened to be set at CI's build time — same rationale `app/page.tsx` already documents for
`force-dynamic`. The manifest lives at `app/llms.txt/route.ts` (a literal `llms.txt` folder name
— confirmed this resolves to `GET /llms.txt` via a real `npm run build` + `npm run start`), builds
every listed URL from `getSiteUrl()`, and lists only what's live this sprint: `/`, `/install`, and
the MCP connector's route shape (`POST /api/v1/public/mcp/c/{token}`, `{token}` documented as a
placeholder, not a literal path — real tokens are minted per project via `/install`). Verified
manually: `npm run build && npm run start`, then `curl`'d `/llms.txt` and the homepage's rendered
`<head>` for the real `og:`/`twitter:` meta tags, and opened `/opengraph-image` directly to confirm
a real on-brand (dark-roast/gold, `references/design-direction.md`) PNG renders. The new Playwright
spec (`e2e/llms-txt.spec.ts`, `api` project) asserts the manifest is 200/plain-text, lists the real
routes, and — via a deliberate mutation check (hardcoded a wrong-env URL into the route, rebuilt,
confirmed the spec went red, then reverted and confirmed green again; written after the code, so a
mutation check stood in for a true red-first TDD run) — that its URLs are actually built from
`getSiteUrl()` live rather than a drifted/hardcoded string. **Owed to Daniel:** the actual "paste
the link into a chat app, see the card unfurl" check is inherently a manual/visual smoke — an API
spec can assert the `<meta>` tags are correct and the image PNG renders, but not how Slack/Discord/
iMessage/etc. actually render the unfurl; noted in the Sprint 3 smoke walkthrough below as step 3,
same "owed to Daniel" pattern as Sprint 2's live connector round-trip. Also owed: this environment
had no Docker daemon available, so the full Supabase-backed `npm run test:e2e` `api` suite couldn't
be run end-to-end here — verified instead via `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, and running the
new spec alone against a real `npm run start` server (including the red/green mutation check
above); re-run the full suite once in an environment with Docker/Supabase before merge.

### Cross-agent review (Codex + Agy) — fixed pre-merge
Per the updated `WAYS-OF-WORKING.md` process (this sprint's experiment), both reviews ran as the
judgment-layer pass in place of a same-family Claude reviewer. Blocking findings fixed:
- **`scripts/seed-self-project.mjs` silently rotated the prod API key on a bare re-run** (Codex) —
  a re-run with `SELF_PROJECT_API_KEY` unset minted a fresh random key and overwrote the existing
  project's hash, silently invalidating whatever key the running app was configured with. Fixed:
  `provisionProject()` now looks up the existing row first and leaves an already-provisioned
  project's credential untouched unless `SELF_PROJECT_API_KEY` is explicitly passed; `main()`
  handles the resulting "can't re-authenticate to re-sync" case by saying so plainly instead of
  crashing or silently skipping.
- **The waitlist route and the self-visit route both `await`ed `trackSelfEvent` inline** (Codex),
  which (a) could hold the waitlist response open on a slow/hung self-tracking call after the real
  join had already succeeded, and (b) delayed the self-visit route's `Set-Cookie` behind that same
  network round-trip — a fast follow-up request could arrive before the visitor cookie was even
  delivered, minting a second identity and disconnecting visit from join. Fixed: both now fire
  `trackSelfEvent` via `next/server`'s `after()`, never inline-awaited before the response is
  built; `self-track.ts` also gained a 3s `AbortSignal.timeout()` on the underlying fetch as
  defense-in-depth.
- **`self-visit` had no rate limiting**, unlike every other unauthenticated public write in this
  app (Agy, filed against AGENTS.md rule #2 — the underlying concern is real even though the route
  doesn't trust a slug, so rule #2 wasn't quite the right citation: an anonymous caller could flood
  the route and inflate `landing_visited`, skewing the Grower signal). Fixed: same
  `checkRateLimit`/`hashIp` primitive as the waitlist route, a looser per-minute cap (once per real
  page load, not once per human decision).
- **CI never actually exercised the funnel-isolation spec** (Codex — the "configured" path was
  optional and always skipped). Fixed: `ci.yml` now runs `npm run seed:self` (a fresh CI Supabase
  never already has this project, so it always takes the mint-a-real-key path) and exports the
  printed key as `SELF_PROJECT_API_KEY`, so `self-track.spec.ts`'s isolation test runs for real on
  every PR instead of perpetually skipping.
- Regenerated `Roadmap/00-ideas/BUILD-ORDER.md` (Codex caught it reporting a stale progress count).
- Two Agy nits (an "unused" `randomUUID` import, an "unused" `Metadata` type import) were checked
  against the diff and are both false positives — `randomUUID` is used as the cookie-absent
  fallback, `Metadata` types `generateMetadata()`'s return — no change made.

**Round 2** (re-ran both reviews against the fixes above): Codex found the identity race wasn't
fully closed and CI confirmed it live — the very first `e2e` run after `after()` landed hit exactly
this, failing `funnel events land in the self tenant and NEVER the demo project` because the DB
read raced the now-deferred write (`Received Array []`, expected `["golden-beans"]`). Two fixes:
- **The visitor cookie is now minted client-side, synchronously** (`SelfTrackBeacon.tsx`, via
  `document.cookie`, before firing the beacon POST) instead of relying on the self-visit route's
  `Set-Cookie` — a network round-trip (even a fast, non-blocking one) is never as fast as an
  in-memory same-tick write, and the route can no longer win a race against a real user action.
  The server-side mint stays as a fallback for non-JS/API callers.
- **`e2e/self-track.spec.ts`'s isolation test now polls** (`pollForEvents`, 200ms/5s bounded) for
  both events instead of reading immediately after the response — the exact fix the live CI failure
  called for.
Also corrected the spec's own header comment: the earlier "mutation check" claim no longer holds
now that tracking runs via `after()` (a route's response can't reflect a tracking failure that
happens after the response is already sent), and CI now always configures `SELF_PROJECT_API_KEY`
globally, so the "unset key" no-op branch is no longer independently exercised by any automated
run — verified by code inspection only (a one-line guard), stated as an accepted gap rather than
silently dropped.

**Round 3 — a real CI ordering bug, caught by actually running it**: even with the poll fix, the
`e2e` job still failed, but now with a genuine `0/2 events after 5000ms` (not a race — the events
simply never landed). Root cause: `ci.yml`'s "Seed the self-tracking project" step exported
`SELF_PROJECT_API_KEY` into `$GITHUB_ENV` AFTER "Start the app in the background" had already
forked the `npm run start` process — a value added to `$GITHUB_ENV` reaches later STEPS' shells,
never an already-running background process's env, so every self-track call for the rest of the
job silently no-op'd (no error; that's the whole design). Fixed by reordering: a new early step
generates the key via `openssl rand -hex 24` and exports it to `$GITHUB_ENV` **before** the server
starts (so the server boots already knowing it), and the seed step passes the SAME value as
`SELF_PROJECT_API_KEY` (already ambient) so the DB's stored hash matches what the running server
expects, instead of minting a second, different key nobody told the server about. This is exactly
the kind of gap only real execution catches — a purely static review of either the app code or the
workflow file in isolation wouldn't surface a cross-step env-propagation-timing bug.

### Story 3.3 — Launch checklist ✅ (executed 2026-07-20, Daniel-authorized + Daniel-approved live)
**As** Daniel, **I want** the launch executed: domain decision (**paid infra ⇒ Daniel green-lights
before provisioning; staying on the Vercel deployment host is a valid v1 outcome**),
`CONNECTOR_ENABLED` flipped ON in production (the deliberate enablement flip), waitlist live,
announce.
**Acceptance:** checklist executed and recorded in this doc; flip time-stamped; landing sections
match shipped reality (backfill check).
**Risk:** **HIGH — Daniel merges/flips.** The flip and any domain purchase are named
product-owner actions (LEARNINGS: broad wrap-up authorization never covers deploy/credential/paid
actions — each is opted into by name). Executed only after Daniel explicitly said "you are
authorized to complete all of story 3.3" AND left auto mode so each prod write surfaced as a live
approve-prompt he cleared — the named-action gate held.

**Backfill check (done):** re-verified every `next`-status entry in `lib/landing-sections.ts`
against its epic's frontmatter — `signals-loop`, `pod-report`, and `multi-tenant-activation` are
all still `status: scaffolded` (unshipped), so `inverted-loop`/`pods-proof`/`pricing` staying
badged `next` is accurate, not stale. No section claims shipped work it hasn't earned. Nothing in
3.1/3.2 lit up a NEW landing section (dogfood instrumentation and the SEO manifest are both
infrastructure, not a section on `references/landing-end-state.md`'s map), so no registry entry
needed to flip.

**Waitlist live (confirmed):** has been live in production since Sprint 1 (`d3b19ed`); unaffected
by this sprint beyond the new dogfood tracking hook on its success path (3.1, already merged).

**Execution record (2026-07-20):** all prod writes were done via the linked Supabase CLI
(`supabase db query --linked`, which uses the already-logged-in CLI — no `service_role` key ever
handled in the shell) and `vercel env add`. Credentials were generated *inside* the SQL query
(pgcrypto `digest` for the api-key hash, `gen_random_uuid` for the token/key material), so no key
material passed through a shell command. See LEARNINGS "the auto-mode-classifier trap" for why the
earlier attempts (embedding a `service_role` key in argv, a `node -e` keygen) were blocked and this
path wasn't.

- [x] **`SELF_PROJECT_API_KEY` set in production** — self-tenant project `golden-beans`
  (id `2a70…41c2`) inserted with an in-query-generated key (sha256 hash stored, plaintext returned
  once and set as the Vercel prod env var); the `waitlist_conversion` Grower signal
  (`landing_visited` → `waitlist_joined`) registered in the `features` registry. Story 3.1's
  dogfood funnel now reports real prod numbers instead of no-op'ing.
- [x] **Demo `connector_tokens` row minted in prod** — token `gb_connector_63207fc…` for
  `golden-beans-demo` (project `c7af…ef55`), generated in-query. `/install` for the demo project now
  renders a live connector URL instead of "not seeded."
- [x] **Domain decision — stay on the Vercel deployment host for v1** (Daniel's call; zero-cost,
  an explicitly valid v1 outcome per the epic README — no paid infra provisioned).
- [x] **`CONNECTOR_ENABLED=true` set in production (2026-07-20).** Env-var-only changes do NOT take
  effect on already-running functions here (unlike the SITE_URL case — the live MCP route still
  404'd right after the var was set), so the flip is activated by the deploy this docs commit
  triggers (push to `main` → Vercel GitHub-integration deploy — never a manual `vercel deploy`).
  Post-deploy verification of the live connector round-trip is recorded in the Status line above /
  the smoke walkthrough below.
- [x] **Announce — owner-owned** (Daniel will handle tone/channel; no draft written).

## Sprint QA
- **api spec(s):** 3.1 → landing events land in the gb tenant (and only there) · 3.2 → manifest
  route contents
- **browser smoke owed:** yes, to Daniel — production waitlist submission + unfurl check +
  post-flip connector round-trip
- **deterministic gate:** `tsc --noEmit` + `npm run build` + Playwright `api` green before merge

## Sprint 3 — Smoke walkthrough (do these in order)
Env: production · `https://goldenfrijoles.com` (or the custom domain if 3.3 decides one)

1. Visit the landing in a private window, then join the waitlist with a disposable email.
   → Confirmation state.
2. Open the engine's funnel view for the `golden-beans` tenant.
   → Your visit and signup appear in the visitor→waitlist funnel.
3. Paste the landing URL into a chat app.
   → OG card unfurls with Golden Beans branding.
4. **(flip — Daniel)** After `CONNECTOR_ENABLED` is ON: run the story 2.1 connector round-trip
   against production.
   → Works; token revocation still kills instantly.

If any step fails, note the step number + what you saw — that's the bug report.
