# Entity journeys — Sprint 1: Definition contract and deterministic subject projection

**Status:** ✅ complete — merged in PR #17 at `ed6397c`; production OFF smoke complete

## Stories

### ✅ Story 1.1 — Versioned journey-definition registry

**As a** tenant owner, **I want** a versioned ordered journey definition, **so that** lifecycle meaning is
explicit and auditable before anyone relies on it.

**Acceptance:** an owner can create a draft, validate bounded predicates, activate one version and create a new
version for later edits; only one version is active; duplicate stage keys and unsafe/high-cardinality predicate
fields fail closed; members and foreign-project identities cannot mutate definitions; every change records
actor/time; `JOURNEY_PROJECTIONS_ENABLED` exists disabled and OFF hides the new seams.

**Risk:** high — additive database migration and authenticated project management; Daniel merges.

**Locked contract / implementation status:** 1–20 uniquely keyed `lower_snake_case` stages; each stage
matches an event name plus at most five exact scalar TAG predicates from `source`, `channel`, `campaign`,
`plan`, and `region` (string values ≤64; numbers are safe integers with absolute value ≤10^15).
Optional cohort entry must name stage 1. Optional retention is
`{stageKey, anchorStageKey, withinDays}`, with an existing anchor at/before the target and a 1–365-day
integer window. Definitions are immutable numbered rows; edits create the next version, and activation moves
one per-project registry pointer. Owner session identity supplies the audit actor; members see the registry
read-only; nonmembers/foreign identities fail closed. The enablement flag is born OFF and returns 404 before
auth/validation. Migration `20260727100000_journey_registry.sql` is applied and aligned in production;
pure/DB/API specs, mutation checks, typecheck and build are green. The authenticated ON browser smoke remains
deliberately deferred until enablement.

### ✅ Story 1.2 — Deterministic subject projection

**As a** product operator, **I want** one subject projected from source events, **so that** I can explain its
current stage, first-entered time and complete ordered history.

**Acceptance:** an import-free evaluator handles ordered, late, duplicate, out-of-order and same-time fixtures;
highest satisfied stage wins; lower-stage events do not regress; same-time ties use canonical event id;
irrelevant events are ignored; response names definition version and source freshness.

**Risk:** low — read-only pure/query logic over existing telemetry.

**Implementation status:** pure query-time evaluation reads only canonical, project-scoped subject facts.
The resolver calls one service-role-only RPC. Its `STABLE` body first runs a bounded
project/entity/subject-scoped measurement and, only after the 10,000-fact/32-MiB checks pass, runs the ordered
JSONB aggregate; both selects share the calling statement's database snapshot. This avoids PostgREST's row cap
and cross-page movement during concurrent ingest without claiming the function body is one SQL select.
Evaluation then orders the complete set by `occurred_at ?? created_at`, then canonical event id, and records
only actual first-satisfaction timestamps. The version is required on API reads, history is definition-stage
order, and freshness reports latest effective fact time separately from latest receipt time. The canonical API
is `GET /api/v1/journeys/<key>/subject?subjectId=<opaque-id>&version=<positive-integer>`; no legacy
`/subjects/<id>` alias exists. PR #17 deployed exact SHA `ed6397c` through the GitHub/Vercel integration.
With the flag OFF, production returned 404 for both the API and UI while `/llms.txt` remained 200.

**PR #17 review disposition:** accepted fixes move owner resolution ahead of every create-payload
validation and make unexpected registry timestamps render fail-safe. The suggested predecessor-gated
progression change was rejected: this epic's approved contract explicitly says highest satisfied stage
wins, lower-stage events never regress, and history records each stage's actual first satisfaction in
stage order. Requiring predecessors would fabricate or suppress facts and change the product semantics.

**PR #17 round-two disposition:** accepted the silent PostgREST-cap finding. An intermediate pagination
implementation proved the cap with a real DB/API fixture placing a qualifying stage and newest freshness fact
after 1,000 earlier rows; round three then replaced pagination with the final bounded `STABLE` snapshot RPC.
Also accepted defensive rejected-promise handling for both UI mutations and lower-snake-case route-key
validation after the OFF/auth gates but before the resolver. The two-project collision tripwire remains.

**PR #17 round-three disposition:** accepted structured owner-side validation for non-string action
arguments and defensive runtime handling for malformed event tags. The unauthorized oracle-order proof
still reaches ownership before those checks. Antigravity's suggestion to remove `service_role` RPC grants
was rejected: the Server Actions and subject route use the server-only service-role client to call these
functions, so after `PUBLIC`/`anon`/`authenticated` are revoked, the explicit `service_role` grants are
the intended and necessary execution path; the function-level anonymous denials remain pinned by DB specs.
Codex's concurrent-ingest finding replaced offset pagination with the single-snapshot aggregate RPC;
its missing-tenant-predicate finding added `project_id` to every create/activate version lookup and update.
The UI now hides obsolete drafts, and the root env reference lists the born-OFF journey gate plus redeploy
requirement.

**PR #17 round-four disposition:** accepted all final precision and test-hygiene findings. Journey
timestamps no longer pass through JavaScript's millisecond-only `Date` representation: the evaluator
normalizes exact Postgres `timestamptz` values to canonical UTC, compares whole seconds plus retained
microseconds before the event-id tie break, and returns the exact source precision. An adversarial pure
fixture and a real DB/API fixture pin `.000100` before `.000900` inside one millisecond; restoring
millisecond-only comparison fails the focused proof. Definition description, event and predicate limits
now count Unicode code points like PostgreSQL `char_length`, with 500/501, 128/129 and 64/65 emoji
boundaries while the independent 32 KiB UTF-8 payload cap remains pinned. Database specs require the
CI-exported local `SUPABASE_DB_URL` and clean audit plus project fixtures through a test-only
migration-owner connection; the production `service_role` grants remain unchanged. Finally, the roadmap
extractor now recognizes status-emoji story headings, and regenerating (never hand-editing)
`BUILD-ORDER.md` reports the accurate 2/6 stories.

**PR #17 round-five disposition:** accepted the workspace-dependency and near-limit JSONB findings:
the web test workspace now declares both `pg` and its types, and the owner command mirrors PostgreSQL's
JSONB text byte accounting before the RPC while retaining the raw 32 KiB request envelope. A schema-valid
boundary fixture pins the same rejection in TypeScript and the database. The roadmap parser regression is
already a required `scripts-guard.yml` / pre-commit test (`cli-tests`), so the suggestion that it was outside
CI was closed with the actual gate evidence. Antigravity's external quota was unavailable for this delta;
its preceding clean verdict was supplemented by a fresh Terra review, whose invalid-calendar finding added
explicit leap-year/day/time validation before timestamp normalization.

**PR #17 final Codex disposition:** accepted the lifetime-history and obsolete-version findings. The
single-snapshot subject RPC now streams a measurement over at most 10,001 project/type/subject-scoped
candidates, aggregates only when the complete history is within 10,000 facts and 32 MiB of aggregate
JSON text, and raises a clear program-limit error otherwise; it never returns a partial projection. Database-backed boundary
fixtures pin success at exactly 10,000 and fail-closed behavior at 10,001. The registry snapshot mapper
now consistently removes never-activated versions at or below the active version while retaining the
immutable activation history and newer actionable drafts, matching the management UI claim.

**PR #17 final hardening disposition:** accepted both remaining should-fixes. Application validation
now rejects U+0000 in optional descriptions and string predicates before PostgreSQL JSONB can reject the
RPC payload, while retaining the existing broader control-character ban for event names. The
migration-owner cleanup helper now fails closed unless `SUPABASE_DB_URL` parses as PostgreSQL on an
explicit loopback host and the local Supabase database port; focused fixtures accept IPv4, IPv6 and
`localhost` local forms while rejecting remote, wrong-port and malformed values without echoing credentials.
The guard also rejects every connection option or fragment because node-postgres otherwise lets query
parameters override the URI authority's host/port after the visible local URL has passed validation.
The same test boundary now requires the independent service-role `SUPABASE_URL` to be the standard
loopback API endpoint, preventing a mixed environment from writing remote fixtures and cleaning locally.
Activation resolves project ownership before validating journey/version identifiers, so foreign callers
cannot use malformed action arguments as a management-seam oracle.

## Sprint QA

- **pure specs:** registry schema/state machine plus evaluator table for ordered/late/duplicate/out-of-order/
  same-time/irrelevant events and no-regression behavior.
- **api specs:** owner/member/foreign definition mutations; API-key project scoping; flag OFF/ON; subject read
  with realistic stable identity and definition version.
- **browser smoke owed:** authenticated ON definition creation/activation remains deferred to Daniel until
  the enablement rollout; the production OFF smoke is complete.
- **deterministic gate:** typecheck + build + Playwright API green; a dedicated built-server OFF pass pins
  journey page/API 404s before the normal ON suite; migration verified locally and applied/aligned in production.

## Sprint 1 — Smoke walkthrough (do these in order)

Env: production · https://goldenfrijoles.com

1. ✅ With `JOURNEY_PROJECTIONS_ENABLED` OFF, open the disposable project's journey-management URL,
   call the subject endpoint without authorization, then open `/llms.txt`.
   → Both new journey seams return 404 (the API does so before auth, never 401) while the existing
   agent manifest returns 200. Confirmed in production on deployed SHA `ed6397c`.
2. **Deferred until enablement:** redeploy with the gate ON, sign in as the disposable project owner and open
   `https://goldenfrijoles.com/app/journeys/<project-slug>`.
   → “Create journey” appears for that project.
3. **Deferred until enablement:** create `merchant_activation` with three ordered smoke stages, then activate version 1.
   → The definition displays one active version and immutable activation history.
4. **Deferred until enablement:** send the three subject events out of order, with one duplicate, then request
   `https://goldenfrijoles.com/api/v1/journeys/merchant_activation/subject?subjectId=merchant-smoke-journey-001&version=1`
   using the disposable API key.
   → One subject returns the correct current stage, first-entered timestamps and version 1.
5. **Deferred until enablement:** try to mutate the definition as a member and through another project's identity.
   → Both are denied and no definition changes.

If any step fails, note the step number + URL/response — that's the bug report.
