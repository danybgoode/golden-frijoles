# Entity journeys — Sprint 3: Miyagi founding-merchant proof and scale decision

**Status:** ✅ complete — PR [#20](https://github.com/danybgoode/golden-beans/pull/20), production `cd62a98`

## Stories

### ✅ Story 3.1 — Miyagi 13-stage founding-merchant proof

**As Miyagi's** activation team, **I want** its activation lifecycle represented as a Golden Beans journey, **so
that** the scorecard consumes reusable analytics while Miyagi keeps merchant work records and Medusa facts.

**Acceptance:** one versioned definition covers scouted through retained-at-30-days; opaque merchant fixtures
reach permission, preview, claim, payments, three-products, share, inquiry, sale and retention from the event
router contract; replay/out-of-order delivery is stable; no name, phone, email, notes, consent body or copied
commerce state enters Golden Beans; both repos share the same contract fixture.

**Risk:** high — cross-repo identity/event contract and real tenant smoke; Daniel merges both PRs.

**Build contract:** the byte-identical canonical fixture is
`apps/web/e2e/_fixtures/merchant-lifecycle.fixtures.json`, pinned to the same SHA-256 as Miyagi's
`e2e/_fixtures/merchant-lifecycle.fixtures.json`. The journey is the 13 `merchant.<stage>` events;
the separate `merchant.preview_approved` delivery signal remains valid but is not a fourteenth analytical stage.
The definition is import-free application data in `lib/founding-merchant-journey.ts`, with no tag predicates or
place to carry merchant PII/CRM/commerce state.

**Implementation status:** Golden Beans now holds the canonical JSON fixture at the exact same
`b53f300b…f3671` digest pinned by Miyagi's active Sprint 3 branch. The valid versionable definition consumes the
13 lifecycle stage events and explicitly leaves `merchant.preview_approved` as the independent fourteenth
delivery signal. Pure proof reverses receipt order, replays canonical ids, and still reaches all 13 stages in
definition order with exact boundary retention. The serialized fixture/definition is structurally checked for
merchant PII and copied workflow/Medusa identifiers.

### ✅ Story 3.2 — Query-time scale decision from measured evidence

**As a** platform owner, **I want** evidence for or against materialization, **so that** Golden Beans adds
projection infrastructure only after the simple architecture stops serving real use.

**Acceptance:** production-safe p50/p95 query timing and relevant-event counts are visible per journey without
subject data; thresholds are p95 >2s or >1M relevant events per project/journey scan; the epic closes with an
evidence-backed keep-query-time decision or a separate materialization scope seed—never hidden work in this epic.

**Risk:** low — bounded operational telemetry and documentation.

**Build contract:** every successful subject/cohort resolver records only project, journey/version, query kind,
duration and relevant-event count through a service-role-only RPC. Each series retains its latest 100 samples
and returns p50/p95 plus the strict `p95 > 2,000 ms` / `max relevant events > 1,000,000` decision. Telemetry
failure never breaks the analytical read and is reported as unavailable; no subject id, tags or result payload
may enter the observation table.

**Implementation status:** migration `20260730100000_journey_query_telemetry.sql` adds a no-policy RLS table
with no subject-shaped columns and a service-role-only transactional RPC. A per-series advisory lock keeps the
latest-sample cap exact under concurrent serverless requests. Subject and cohort queries record their own
duration/relevant count after evaluation, then expose bounded samples, p50, p95, maximum relevant-event count,
thresholds and the descriptive keep/materialize signal through the existing API/UI/MCP result. Instrumentation
errors degrade to `telemetry_unavailable` without changing the valid analytical answer.

## Sprint QA

- **contract specs:** identical 13-stage fixtures in Golden Beans and Miyagi, including duplicates, late events,
  definition version and PII allowlist.
- **scale specs:** bounded timing/count telemetry, no subject identifiers, threshold-boundary behavior.
- **browser smoke owed:** yes, to Daniel — authenticated production Miyagi merchant lifecycle + Golden Beans
  journey/scorecard comparison. Golden Beans API + MCP production proof is complete; the shared live-smoke
  skill is Miyagi-path-specific and cannot drive Golden Beans' authenticated page.
- **deterministic gate:** both repos' typecheck/build/API suites green before merge.

**Local evidence:** clean local migration reset through `20260730100000`; 16/16 definition/fixture/telemetry
property specs passed, including function-level anonymous denial, cross-project version refusal, direct
service-role table denial, exact percentile values, exact 100-row cap and schema redaction. Existing
subject/cohort/API/MCP suites passed 12/12 with telemetry assertions; typecheck and production build are green.
PR #20's deterministic CI passed typecheck/build and the complete local-Supabase/production-built Playwright
gate (288 passed, 3 intentionally skipped). Agy and Devin each returned CLEAN on exact head `dd6ae94`.

**Production evidence (2026-07-23):** migration `20260730100000` is aligned locally/remotely;
`JOURNEY_PROJECTIONS_ENABLED=true` was captured by the Git-tracked production deployment
`cd62a98cdc65628a360bf36948b946d6660f4504` (Vercel `dpl_G6C1mB1NNkqW2xrVtaHFDq8xjkNA`, Ready).
The `golden-beans` self tenant owns active `merchant_activation` v1. Disposable opaque subject
`proof_entity_s3_cd62a98` ingested all 13 lifecycle facts through `POST /api/v1/track` with canonical
idempotency keys; subject projection returned 13 history stages and current stage `retained_30d`.
The June cohort contained exactly that subject across all 13 stages with one met retention outcome.
The same cohort resolved through MCP's `get_journey_cohort`.

Measured decision: **keep query-time projection**. Subject evidence reached 8 samples, p50 88.48 ms /
p95 118.87 ms / max 13 relevant events. API cohort evidence reached 5 samples, p50 69.74 ms /
p95 73.94 ms / max 13; the sixth MCP sample produced p95 119.32 ms. Every series remained far below
the strict p95 >2,000 ms or >1,000,000 relevant-event tripwires. Both one-use API keys and the temporary
connector token were revoked after proof (zero active proof credentials).

## Sprint 3 — Smoke walkthrough (do these in order)

Env: https://goldenfrijoles.com + https://miyagisanchez.com

1. ✅ Activate reviewed `merchant_activation` v1 for the `golden-beans` self tenant.
   → Audited registry RPCs created and activated the exact 13-stage contract.
2. ✅ Send the 13-stage proof through normal `/api/v1/track`.
   → Only opaque subject `proof_entity_s3_cd62a98` and lifecycle facts entered Golden Beans.
3. ✅ Replay the same canonical idempotency keys.
   → One logical 13-stage history remained; no duplicate journey stages appeared.
4. ✅ Inspect subject, cohort and MCP outputs.
   → API/MCP agreed, retention was met, diagnostics held counts/timing only, and no credential remained active.
5. ✅ Compare evidence to the p95/1M tripwires.
   → **Keep query-time**; no materialization seed is justified.
6. ⏳ Open the real merchant in Miyagi beside the authenticated Golden Beans journey page.
   → Product-owner browser/session confirmation remains owed; the analytical API/MCP path is live and proven.

If any step fails, note the step number + event/subject id — that's the bug report.
