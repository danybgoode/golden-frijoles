# Site URL preview-aware — Sprint 1: The seam, its guards, and a preview that proves it

**Status:** ✅ shipped — [`c2589e1`](https://github.com/danybgoode/golden-beans/pull/116)

> **Build contract.** One function changes. Read the epic README's **D1** (SITE_URL still wins),
> **D2** (preview only), **D3** (branch URL over deployment URL), **D4** (why the dangerous call
> sites are safe, and why that safety is fragile) and **D5** (the acceptance is a preview, not a
> unit test) before starting.
>
> **The rule that must survive this epic intact:** AGENTS.md #5 forbids a request `Host` fallback.
> A platform-set environment variable is not a request header. If any part of this diff reads
> anything off the incoming request, it is wrong.

## Build contract (locked by the architect before the builder started)

**Production cannot change, and it is provable by ordering rather than by promise.** `SITE_URL` is
set in Production (`vercel env ls`), so `getSiteUrl()` returns before the new branch is evaluated.
A spec asserts this directly rather than leaving it to the argument.

**`isSiteUrlMisconfiguredInProduction()` is not touched.** A production deploy missing `SITE_URL`
must keep failing loud. Silently serving its own `*.vercel.app` deployment URL instead of
`goldenfrijoles.com` would be a worse bug than the one being fixed, and an invisible one.

**Every new branch gets a mutation check.** This is a shared seam with ~20 call sites including auth
redirects and credential-bearing URLs; a guard that cannot fail here is worse than no guard
(CODE-QUALITY #5b). Break each branch, watch it go red, restore **from a file copy taken
beforehand** — never with `git checkout`, which discards uncommitted work (LEARNINGS, 2026-08-20).

**The epic is not done when the tests pass.** D5: unit tests cannot prove Vercel exposes
`VERCEL_ENV` / `VERCEL_BRANCH_URL` at runtime for this project. Story 1.4 is the acceptance.

## Stories

### Story 1.1 — `getSiteUrl()` knows it is on a preview
**As** anyone verifying a change on a preview deployment, **I want** the preview's own URLs in its
own output, **so that** I can actually exercise the surface before it merges.

**Acceptance:**
- `getSiteUrl()` resolves in this order, and no other:
  1. `SITE_URL`, trimmed, trailing slashes stripped — unchanged, and still first.
  2. **Only when `VERCEL_ENV === 'preview'`:** `https://` + `VERCEL_BRANCH_URL`, else
     `https://` + `VERCEL_URL`.
  3. `http://localhost:3000`.
- The scheme is hardcoded `https://`. Vercel serves preview deployments over TLS, and these
  variables carry a bare hostname with no scheme.
- The value is normalised the same way `SITE_URL` is (trimmed, no trailing slash), so callers that
  string-concatenate `${siteUrl}/install` cannot produce a double slash.
- Nothing is read from the request. No `headers()`, no `Host`, no `x-forwarded-*`.
- `lib/site-url-resolve.test.ts` covers, as ARGUMENTS rather than stubbed environment variables
  (epic A1 moved the order into a pure module): SITE_URL wins over a present VERCEL_BRANCH_URL ·
  preview + branch URL · preview + only VERCEL_URL · preview with neither → localhost ·
  **production without SITE_URL → localhost, not the deployment URL** · development → localhost ·
  trailing-slash and whitespace normalisation · an empty-string SITE_URL treated as unset.
- The header comment explains **why a platform variable is not a Host header**, in the terms the
  epic README uses, so the next reader does not revert it citing AGENTS rule #5.
**Risk:** medium
**QA:** `lib/site-url-resolve.test.ts`, every branch mutation-checked

### Story 1.2 — The comments that now say the opposite
**As** the next person to read these files, **I want** them to describe the function that exists,
**so that** I am not reasoning from a sentence that was true last week.

**Acceptance:**
- `lib/landing-prompts.ts`, `components/landing/MakerHero.tsx` and
  `app/northstar-self-serve.md/route.ts` each currently assert that `getSiteUrl()` *never* derives a
  deployment's own hostname. All three are corrected (epic D6).
- Each correction says what is now true **and keeps the point the original was making** — that no
  production hostname is hardcoded in source, and that the specs exercise these surfaces against the
  run's own base URL.
- `grep` for the claim across the repo afterwards; fix the class, not the three files the epic
  happened to name.
**Risk:** low
**QA:** grep + review

### Story 1.3 — The dangerous call sites are guarded by a spec, not by a paragraph
**As** a maintainer widening an environment variable a year from now, **I want** to be told that I
have just made preview-minted URLs reachable, **so that** I find out from a red test rather than
from a customer holding a dead link.

**Acceptance:**
- Epic D4's safety property is currently a fact about Vercel project configuration and a paragraph
  in a README. It becomes an assertion in the repo.
- The guard names the **durable-URL** call sites — connector token URLs, report share links, the
  signup `emailRedirectTo`, the auth callback redirect base — and asserts that each is reachable
  only behind something Production-scoped, so a preview cannot mint one.
- It fails loudly with a message that explains the consequence, not just the mismatch. A maintainer
  who trips it should learn *why* it exists in the failure output.
- Written so it cannot pass vacuously: mutation-check it by making one of those paths look reachable
  and watching it go red.
**Risk:** medium
**QA:** the new guard, mutation-checked

### Story 1.4 — Observe it on a real preview
**As** the product owner, **I want** the fix demonstrated on a real preview URL, **so that** we know
Vercel actually exposes the variables rather than trusting that it does.

**Acceptance:**
- Push the branch, let Vercel build the preview, then **fetch the preview's own URLs**:
  - `curl <preview>/llms.txt` → every absolute URL is the preview host, not `localhost:3000`.
  - `curl <preview>/northstar-self-serve.md` → same, including `${siteUrl}/install`.
  - Load `<preview>/` and read the hero prompt → it names the preview host.
- **If it still says `localhost`, that is the finding**, and the fix is a Vercel project setting
  (system environment variables not exposed) rather than this code. Record it and stop — do not
  reach for a Host header.
- Production is re-checked after merge: `https://goldenfrijoles.com/llms.txt` still says
  `goldenfrijoles.com`, proving D1's ordering held.
**Risk:** medium
**QA:** **owed as an observation, not an assertion** — a real preview, fetched by hand

## Sprint QA

- `lib/site-url-resolve.test.ts` — new, all six branches observed failing.
- `lib/site-url-callers.test.ts` — the Story 1.3 registry guard, three mutations observed failing.
- Every pre-existing spec that pins a single host (`llms-txt`, `northstar-self-serve`,
  `landing-prompts`) green **without being edited** — they run against localhost, where behaviour is
  unchanged, so an edit to any of them in this diff is a review stop.
- Deterministic gate: `npm run typecheck` (four projects) + `npm run lint` + `npm run test:unit` +
  Playwright `api`.

## Smoke walkthrough

Steps 1–5 were run against the real preview for PR #116 and are recorded with what came back.
Steps 6–7 are the post-merge production re-check.

**Preview:** `<preview URL>`

Note the shape of that hostname: `…-git-feat-site-url-prev-…`. It is the **branch** URL, not the
per-deployment one, which is the observable proof that `VERCEL_BRANCH_URL` is what resolved (epic
D3) rather than `VERCEL_URL`.

> Preview deployments on this project are **SSO-protected**, so `curl` gets a 302 to
> `vercel.com/sso-api`. Use the Vercel MCP `web_fetch_vercel_url`, or mint a temporary link with
> `get_access_to_vercel_url` and follow cookies (`curl -L -c jar -b jar`). This is not a finding —
> it is how the project is configured.

1. Fetch `<preview>/llms.txt`.
   → **200.** Every absolute URL in the body is the preview's own hostname.
2. Extract every host from that body.
   → exactly one: the preview host. **Zero occurrences of `localhost`.**
3. Fetch `<preview>/northstar-self-serve.md`.
   → **200**, 16,878 bytes. Hosts: the preview host **and** `https://amplitude.com` — the citation
   allow-listed by `agentic-pm-public-surface` A10, which confirms that guard still behaves on a
   non-production host. **Zero occurrences of `localhost`.**
4. Grep that body for the hand-off line.
   → `Start here: https://<preview URL>/install` — the line that
   used to read `http://localhost:3000/install`.
5. **This is the acceptance no unit test could give** (epic D5): before this, nothing in the repo
   had ever demonstrated that Vercel exposes `VERCEL_ENV` / `VERCEL_BRANCH_URL` to a running
   function. It does.
6. **After merge — run, and green.** `curl -s https://goldenfrijoles.com/llms.txt | grep -oE 'https?://[^/ ]+' | sort -u`
   → `https://goldenfrijoles.com`, and nothing else. The workshop returns that plus
   `https://amplitude.com`, the allow-listed citation. Proves D1's ordering held: production never
   reached the new branch.
7. **After merge — run, and green.** `grep -c 'vercel.app'` against `/llms.txt` and `/` → **0** and
   **0**. `grep -c 'localhost'` → **0**. No deployment hostname leaked onto the canonical domain.
