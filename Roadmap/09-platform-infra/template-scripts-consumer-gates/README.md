# Epic: Template scripts hold to the gates their consumers run

> **Area:** 09-platform-infra · **Risk:** high · **Class:** Chore · **Scope seed:** [`00-ideas/seeds/template-scripts-consumer-gates.md`](../../00-ideas/seeds/template-scripts-consumer-gates.md)
<!-- Class (above) is the Stage-2 classification: Feature, Spike, Bug, or Chore — see SKILL.md's
     Stage 2 table; sourced from scaffold-epic.mjs's --type flag (a fixed 4-value enum, not free
     text — a longer description belongs in the Why section below, not here; this comment never names
     that heading literally, so an edit anchored on it cannot land inside the comment).
     Optional: if this epic was ALSO tagged with an archetype at refining (see spike-role-archetypes.md),
     append " · **Archetype:** <Prototyper|Builder|Sweeper|Grower|Maintainer>" after Class. Omit entirely
     for the Builder default — untagged is fine.
     Scope-seed link: always points at seeds/ — lifecycle lives in the seed's `status:` frontmatter, not
     in a folder path (see 00-ideas/README.md). If this epic was scaffolded from a doc that has no seeds/
     entry, link that doc instead and migrate it to seeds/ when convenient — don't fabricate a seeds/ file
     that doesn't exist. -->

## Why
Keeps the plugin's shared scripts from breaking the projects that copy them: lint caught at the source, scripts that
run through a symlinked path instead of silently exiting 0, and a smoke probe that can't be pointed at an internal
address. Three chores merged into one plugin release (2026-10-14).


## Platform-first note
No product surface. Rules #1–#6 untouched. The scripts live in `skills/` (mirrored to golden-frijoles/skills), so the
work is a plugin release (`skills/RELEASING.md`).


## What already exists (reuse, don't rebuild)
- `eslint.config.mjs`, `scripts/render-skills-ci.mjs` → `.github/workflows/skills-ci.yml`, `scripts/check-script-parity.mjs`.
- `skills/template/scripts/lib/config.mjs` and `render-ways-of-working.mjs` (the realpath form).
- `skills/template/scripts/perf-probe.mjs`, `smoke.perf` in `golden-frijoles.config.json`.


## Scope — stories
| Sprint | Story | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | S1.1 Lint at the source · S1.2 isMain by realpath · S1.3 perf-probe targets | high |

## Deploy order
One plugin release, which can share its window with `build-view-one-story`. No migration, no flag.


## Definition of Done (epic)
- [ ] All sprints merged to `main` + smoke-tested (gaps stated — `node scripts/owed-ledger.mjs` counts what is still owed)
- [ ] Each `sprint-N.md` has its smoke walkthrough (real URLs)
- [ ] This README marked ✅; every sprint status ticked with commit refs
- [ ] `RETROSPECTIVE.md` written
- [ ] Product poster (`Roadmap/README.md`) updated
- [ ] Team memory + `MEMORY.md` index updated
- [ ] Durable learnings promoted to `Roadmap/LEARNINGS.md` (dedupe — sharpen, don't append)
- [ ] **Kill-switch (only if one was planned at refining — Stage 6b):** the flag slice shipped, the flag
      exists **in Golden Frijoles, in every env**, with the stated polarity, **and its switch is set there** —
      `frijoles flags get <key>` must print `on vN` or `off vN` in its PRODUCTION row (a bare `off` with no version
      means nothing is served there, so the app runs on its own built-in default). A newly synced flag goes live as written in its file; a sync never switches an existing one. *Verify-only — not a new gate; whether a high-risk epic needs one
      is decided at refining, not here.*
- [ ] Feature branch deleted; **this README's frontmatter `status: shipped`** (the SSOT — the board & Notion derive from it; run `node scripts/build-order.mjs`)
