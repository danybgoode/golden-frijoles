# scripts/ — where these come from

Two kinds of script live here, and the difference matters when you change one.

## Served by `@golden-frijoles/kit`, not copied here (golden-frijoles-plugin S2.5)

The `golden-frijoles` plugin's skills run `scripts/<name>.mjs` when this repo has it, and otherwise the pinned
`npx -y @golden-frijoles/kit@<version> <name>` (the run rule is stamped into every SKILL.md). These were
unmodified copies of the template, and nothing this repo keeps (CI, hooks, `package.json`, another kept
script or test) reaches them, so they were deleted and the kit serves them. Their old tests passed 52/52
against the kit build before the deletion.

| Deleted | So these skill steps run from the kit |
|---|---|
| `babysit-pr.mjs` (+ test) | `babysit-pr`, entirely |
| `doc-hygiene.mjs` | `doc-hygiene`'s entry (`doc-format.mjs` stays: its contract test runs here) |
| `preflight.mjs`, `lib/golden-onboarding.mjs` (+ test) | `refine`'s provider check. It still fails here, correctly; see the note below |

`node <foundation>/scripts/check-skill-scripts.mjs --repo-root .` checks this split: a local script needs its
whole closure, an absent one is served by the kit.

**`build-order-sync.mjs` stays here on purpose.** Through the kit it runs the kit's own extractor, but this repo's
`roadmap-extract.mjs` is a fork (it delegates to the Notion sync and labels areas this project's way). Measured
in S2.5, the kit's `--dry-run` wanted to rewrite 58 lines of `BUILD-ORDER.md` that the local run calls up to
date. A skill moves to the kit only when its output is unchanged. Delete this copy only after the extractor
fork is gone.

## Shared rails — byte-identical to `golden-frijoles/skills` `template/scripts/`

These are the golden-frijoles plugin's skills' scripts, ported by the foundation's
`plugin-audit-and-extraction` epic (Sprint 3, story 3.3). **Change them in the template and copy
back — never fork them here.** A fork is how a rail ends up with three implementations. They resolve
paths through `lib/project-root.mjs` (golden-frijoles-plugin D2), which is why a copy here and the kit
run the same bytes.

| Rail | Files | This project's values |
|---|---|---|
| Prose writer + guard | `lib/prose-writer.mjs`, `lib/prose-guard.mjs`, `prose-draft.mjs`, `prose/cpo-persona.md`, `prose/internal.task.md` (+ tests) | `reporting.config.json` → `prose.extraBannedToolNames` |
| Reporting skills | `standup.mjs`, `weekly-recap.mjs`, `pmo-report.mjs`, `lib/{reporting-config,prose-brief,telegram-format,log-branch,gh-rest,standup-deck,report-registry,pmo-*}.mjs`, `prose/`, `pmo/`, `standup/` | `reporting.config.json` (committed; `vercelProject` names the project the stale-preview count reads; the chat id is NOT in it — this repo is public: `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`, or a gitignored `reporting.config.local.json`) |
| PR / board / docs skills | `build-order.mjs`, `lib/roadmap-status-buckets.mjs`, `build-order-sync.mjs`, `doc-format.mjs`, `vercel-prune-previews.mjs` (the kit serves `babysit-pr` and `doc-hygiene`, above) | `doc-format.enforced.json` (all of `Roadmap/` — every doc was brought to the template shape on adoption) |
| Browser smoke | `live-smoke.mjs`, `apps/web/e2e/_live/ad-hoc.browser.spec.ts`, `apps/web/e2e/_helpers/auth.ts` | `live-smoke.config.json` (unauthed; the authed rail stays this repo's own `authed` Playwright project) |
| Roadmap frontmatter contract | `lib/roadmap-contract.mjs` (the one definition), `doc-format.mjs` (enforces it), `roadmap-backfill.mjs` (brought this repo's 29 epics onto it — findings in `Roadmap/00-ideas/audits/frontmatter-backfill-2026-09-19.md`) (+ tests) | none — `doc-format.enforced.json` already enforces all of `Roadmap/`, so every epic doc is held to the contract from this PR on |
| The build view resolver | `build-state.mjs` (+ test), `lib/session-journal.mjs` (the journal line format it reads) | none — `node scripts/build-state.mjs [--json] [--offline]` answers "what is being built right now" from the frontmatter contract, git and one `gh` call; read-only |
| Jev semantic guards | `lib/jev.mjs` (the one TypeSafe client), `lib/review-guard.mjs` (`judgeReviewOutput`), `lib/prose-guard.mjs` (`judgeProse`), `jev-eval.mjs` + `jev-eval.fixtures.json` (labelled replay; CI), `jev-backtest.mjs`, `git-fixtures-sealed.test.mjs` (+ tests) | the committed root **`jev.config.json`** (per-rail `mode: off \| shadow \| jev`, the kill-switch); the key is `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` in the env or the gitignored `.env.local` |

`lib/cross-agent-cli.mjs` is this project's own (see below) but gained the template's `runDevin` export,
which the shared prose writer needs.

`roadmap-extract.mjs` is the template's, byte for byte (board-sinks-and-scrumban D15): it used to delegate to
this project's `roadmap-to-notion.mjs --extract`, a fork that had drifted. Now the Notion sync imports `buildRows()`
from it, like every other sink.

### `preflight` fails in THIS repo, and that is the right answer

It is the ways-of-work mandate that a project spawned from the template reads its flags from Golden
Frijoles: `preflight.mjs` checks that a project is linked, that a `flag_read` key resolves a
snapshot, and that the CLI is installed and current. **This repo is the other end of that wire** — it
*is* Golden Frijoles. It serves `/api/v1/flags/snapshot`; it does not consume it, and its
`.env.local` carries this product's own service configuration, not a `GOLDEN_FRIJOLES_FLAG_READ_KEY`
pointing at itself.

So `npx -y @golden-frijoles/kit@<version> preflight` here prints ✅ for the CLI, the version and the SDK (both
are workspace packages) and ❌ for `project` and `flag-read-key`. That is the check telling the truth: this
repo is not a consumer. (It used to live here as a copy because a skill's script had to exist locally. Since
S2.5 the kit serves it, which is the honest version of the same thing: the real script, not a stub.)

**Do not "fix" the red by inventing a self-pointing key.** If you ever do want to exercise it against
a real project, point it at one with the three `GOLDEN_FRIJOLES_*` variables in the environment.

## This project's own rails — deliberately divergent, with reasons

A rail listed here has a sibling in the template. Each is kept on purpose; the reason is the part to
re-check before "unifying" it.

- **`standup-report.mjs`** — a LOCAL, git-derived prose report (writer + guard, `--post`), run by a person
  or the report daemon. The template's `standup.mjs` is a ROUTINE-driven, multi-repo PR/CI/board delta
  report. Different inputs, different trigger, different reader; both now use the one shared prose
  writer and guard. The plugin's `report` skill (daily chapter) runs the template one.
- **`commit-report.mjs` + `report-new-commits.mjs` + `report-main-daemon.mjs`** (and `launchd/`) — the
  merge-report rail, which *originated here*. It posts to Telegram **and Slack**, checkpoints
  exactly-once **per channel**, and retries from a launchd daemon because the prose writers have no
  headless auth. The template ships the simpler single-channel, hook-driven `merge-report.mjs` (the origin
  project's). This one is a superset the template does not need; it shares the prose writer and guard.
- **`pod-report.mjs`** (+ `lib/pod-metrics.mjs`) — not ops reporting: it computes the Pod Report
  *artifact* this product serves. The template's `pmo-report.mjs` reports on the project's own delivery.
- **Project fill-ins** — `prose-lessons.md` (this project's own lessons), `routines/README.md` and
  `review-config.json` (its routines and review routing; the template ships both as fill-ins), and the three
  review prompts (`cross-review.prompt.md`, `cross-review.security.prompt.md`, `cross-panel.prompt.md`), whose
  rules and vulnerability classes are this project's own. The review rail's CODE is shared, not forked:
  `cross-review.mjs`, `lib/cross-agent-cli.mjs`, `cross-agent-doctor.mjs` (+ its `agy-doctor.mjs` alias),
  `cross-panel.mjs`, `review-route.mjs`, `lib/review-guard.mjs` and their tests are byte-identical to the
  template since distribute-what-we-use S1 (2026-09-29), which merged this copy, the template's and a second
  consumer's into one superset. `prose/cpo-persona.md` is
  still the template's NEUTRAL copy (generic example people), byte-identical on purpose until someone
  fills it in for this product. It only reaches `prose-draft.mjs` here, and that tool's previous prompt
  was the template's neutral one too. The merge report, the surface that matters, keeps its own
  `commit-report.prompt.md`.
