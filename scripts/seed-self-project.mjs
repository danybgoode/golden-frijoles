// seed-self-project.mjs — Story 3.1 (Roadmap/02-commercial/commercial-shell/sprint-3.md). Seeds
// (idempotently, re-runnable) the SELF tenant — the engine's own project, the one the public landing
// dogfoods its funnels into. Since one-product-project D1 (2026-10-08) that is the public
// `golden-frijoles` project seed-demo-project.mjs makes: Golden Frijoles is built in the open, in one
// project. It is still never Miyagi's (AGENTS.md rules #1/#2). Sibling of seed-demo-project.mjs and
// the same shape: the PROJECT ROW is a direct Supabase upsert (there's no self-serve signup API),
// but the Grower SIGNAL is registered through the REAL Bearer-authed API, never a raw DB write.
//
// Uses raw fetch() rather than importing @golden-frijoles/sdk for the same reason the demo script
// does: the SDK ships as un-transpiled TS with extensionless internal imports that plain `node`
// can't resolve (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND). The /features/sync payload below is byte-identical to what
// the SDK's syncFeatures() sends (packages/sdk/src/index.ts).
//
// Env vars:
//   SUPABASE_URL / SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY — provisioning (the project row upsert)
//   GROWTH_ENGINE_URL                        — the running server the fetch calls target
//                                              (defaults to http://localhost:3000)
//   SELF_PROJECT_SLUG                        — optional slug override (default DEMO_PROJECT_SLUG),
//                                              matching lib/self-track.ts's env pattern.
//   SELF_PROJECT_API_KEY                     — optional; if set, hash+upsert this fixed value
//                                              instead of minting a fresh random key each run, so
//                                              the SAME key can be exported into the app's env
//                                              (this is the key the landing's self-track helper
//                                              authenticates with).
