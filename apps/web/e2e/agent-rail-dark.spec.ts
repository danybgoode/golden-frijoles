// app-shell-and-agent-rail · Sprint 2, Story 2.2 — the rail's dark path.
//
// ── What this file asserts, and what it CANNOT ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Stating the split up front, because LEARNINGS is explicit that a spec which looks like it covers
// a surface but only reaches its edge is worse than an absent one: the next reader stops there.
//
// The rail renders on signed-in /app routes only. The always-on `api` project has no session, so it
// cannot reach a render where the flag is the deciding factor: with AGENT_RAIL_ENABLED ON *or* OFF,
// an anonymous request sees no rail — there is no resolved membership to render one for. A spec
// here that asserted "absent while dark" would therefore pass for the wrong reason, and would keep
// passing if the flag were hardwired to true.
//
// So the work is split three ways, deliberately:
//   • the FLAG POLARITY            → apps/web/lib/flags.test.ts (born OFF, exact `=== 'true'`,
//                                     the full near-miss matrix every gate in this repo inherits)
//   • the RENDER DECISION          → apps/web/lib/agent-rail-visibility.test.ts (mutation-checked:
//                                     break the polarity and that file goes red)
//   • the ANONYMOUS BOUNDARY       → here, where it is genuinely reachable and genuinely a security
//                                     property: a tenant's activity trail must never be served to
//                                     someone with no session, whatever the flag says.
//   • the RENDERED behaviour       → e2e/agent-rail.authed.spec.ts (opt-in browser smoke)

// Every marker the rail puts in the DOM. Checked as strings against the response body rather than
// through a parser: this asserts that the bytes never leave the server, which is the actual claim.
const RAIL_MARKERS = ['agent-rail', 'Recent activity', 'Waiting on you']

// The anonymously-reachable /app surfaces. The demo project's dashboards render without a session
// (lib/dashboard-auth.ts' allow-listed carve-out) and they use the same ProductShell the rail lives
// in — which makes them the exact place a rail rendered above the membership check would leak.
