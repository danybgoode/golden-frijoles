// app-shell-and-agent-rail · Sprint 2 — the rail's RENDERED behaviour.
//
// The `authed` project is the only harness in this repo with a real session, so it is the only
// place the rail can be seen at all (e2e/agent-rail-dark.spec.ts explains the split). It is opt-in,
// not part of the blocking gate: `npm run test:e2e:authed`.
//
// Everything asserted here is something an API-level check structurally cannot see — a disclosure
// that opens and closes, a sheet that does not overflow a phone, and the D4 copy as it actually
// reaches a reader.

// ── ⚠️ The agent rail does not render on console routes (Daniel, 2026-08-28) ─────────────────
//
// CONSOLE-CONTRACT.md Do-not #4: the rail is in none of the ten approved reference states, and
// inside the console grid it squeezed the content column to 544px against the approved 1180 —
// which is why every table clipped. The epic had left this undecided; it is decided now.
//
// `header !== null` IS the console, and after A19 that is every signed-in /app route, so in
// practice the rail no longer renders anywhere. These specs asserted the opposite on every route,
// and they are the correct place to record what replaced them rather than being deleted quietly:
// a deleted spec leaves no trace of a capability that used to exist.
//
// What the rail carried — the agent's recent activity and its waiting-on-you queue — has a home in
// the approved design: "What changed & why" in the top bar. **That is not built yet.** Until it is,
// this suite is the record that a surface was removed ahead of its replacement, which is the thing
// this epic keeps promising not to do.
