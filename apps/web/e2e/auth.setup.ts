// Authed browser smoke — the setup half.
//
// ── Why drive the real login form instead of injecting session cookies ────────────────────────
// Injecting cookies from an admin-issued session is faster and is what most harnesses do. It also
// means the ONE flow most likely to break silently — a real human typing an email and a password
// into our actual form — is never exercised by anything. Driving the form once per run costs a few
// seconds and covers it for free; every authed spec then reuses the resulting storageState and
// starts already signed in.
//
// ── Why this is not in the CI gate ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Chromium binaries are heavy and slow, and WAYS-OF-WORKING is explicit that the `browser` project
// is opt-in and NOT the blocking gate. The point of this harness is different: a browser spec
// REPLACES a browser smoke otherwise owed to the product owner, so it converts the mechanical half
// of that manual pass into automation and leaves him only the judgement calls.
//
// ── The fixture is DISPOSABLE and cleaned up ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A real auth user plus a real tenant are created here and removed by auth.teardown.ts. Everything
// is namespaced with a run-unique suffix so two concurrent runs cannot collide, and so a crashed
// run leaves an obviously-labelled orphan rather than a plausible-looking real tenant.

 * has two experiments and BOTH are `decided` (D10), so neither state is reachable on any live

 * rendered by nothing, with data, ever.
 *
 * `lib/experiment-interval.test.ts` pins the arithmetic against independently computed values. What
 * only this can cover is the WIRING: that the page reads the interval the analysis computed, for the
 * right arms, and renders the sentence that matches whether it crosses zero.
 *
 * ── Why the real RPC and the real ingest shape ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The version is created and started through `create_experiment_version` /
 * `transition_experiment_version` — the same path the console uses — because a hand-inserted row
 * could carry a lifecycle the governance layer would never produce. The events are written directly,
 * matching `get_experiment_analysis_events`' own predicates (`experiment_exposed` with
 * `feature_id = <key>` and a `variant` tag, then the metric event); driving 400 of them through
 * `/api/v1/track` would spend a minute of every authed run for no additional coverage.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The numbers are chosen to CLEAR zero, deliberately.** 200 exposures per arm against a
 * declared minimum of 150, converting 40 and 70 — a lift near +75% whose 95% interval sits well
 * above zero. An interval that crossed zero would make the spec's "does not cross zero" assertion
 * pass or fail on rounding, and a fixture whose meaning depends on rounding is a fixture that goes
 * red for the wrong reason one release later.

/**
 * Seed the ONE fixture feature that has a funnel — design-system-rails Story 4.2.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A funnel needs a row in a DIFFERENT registry from the one a flag lives in.**
 * `getFeatureFunnelByProjectId` reads `features` (the TARS signal registry); a flag lives in
 * `flag_registries`. The two have separate lifecycles and separate naming conventions, and on
 * production `miyagisanchez` they have ZERO overlap — 42 flag registries, one TARS feature
 * (`setup_guide`), so every flag a reader can click renders the Funnel tab's empty state.
 *
 * That empty state is a deliverable and is asserted on a scenario flag. What could NOT be asserted
 * without this is the other half: that when a feature does have a funnel, the tab renders NUMBERS.
 * The sprint contract puts that spec on `setup_guide`, which is production data CI cannot reach —
 * so this is its local counterpart, registered in BOTH registries with a real event history.
 *
 * Written through the service client rather than `/api/v1/features/sync` + `/api/v1/track` because
 * both need a project API key, and the fixture never captures one: provisioning shows the plaintext
 * once, in the onboarding UI, and never again. Same reasoning as `seedImpactFixture` above, and the
 * same teardown story — every table here is `REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`.
 *
 * The counts are 3 targeted / 2 adopted / 1 retained, deliberately all different: a spec asserting
 * "the funnel renders numbers" against three equal values could pass on a page rendering one number
 * three times.

 * Enough Activity history for PAGINATION to be observable — mockups-as-built · Story 3.2.

 * `ship-activity` state draws twelve entries and production holds 148 (epic D13-b), so twelve is the
 * page size — and every other fixture in this file produces a handful of audit rows at most, which
 * is exactly the "fixture with ONE of something" shape this repo has already paid for (LEARNINGS:
 * `.at(-1)` took the oldest version and everything stayed green).
 *
 * `AUDIT_FIXTURE_ROWS` is deliberately more than two pages, so `page=2` is neither the first nor the
 * last — a two-page fixture would let a bug that always returns the last page pass.
 *
 * Written through the service client rather than through the flag RPCs: `create_flag_definition_version`
 * writes ONE audit row per call and would need `AUDIT_FIXTURE_ROWS` real definitions to produce them,
 * which is a fixture about flags rather than about a list. The rows here are the same shape the RPC
 * writes — `flag_lifecycle_audit` has a `CHECK` on `action` and on `reason`, and both are honoured,
 * so a row that the product could not have produced cannot be seeded by accident.
 *
 * ⚠️ `created_at` is set EXPLICITLY and descending, because the page is "newest first" and a bulk
 * insert would give every row the same `now()` — an ordering assertion over rows with one timestamp
 * is an assertion that cannot fail.
 *
 * No teardown counterpart: `flag_lifecycle_audit.project_id` cascades, and `test-db-cleanup.ts`

/**
 * A REAL pushed pod-report artifact — mockups-as-built · Sprint 4, Stories 4.4 and 4.5.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Without one, `/hub/report` and `/s/[token]` render their EMPTY states, and the approved
 * states describe populated ones.** `hub-report` is `head → provenance → document` and
 * `public-share` is `sharehead → provenance → document`; a tenant that has never pushed an artifact
 * renders `head → list` (the "nothing pushed yet" card) on both. So the two routes could not have
 * matched their pictures for any amount of work on the pages — it was a fixture gap wearing a
 * product defect's clothes, the third one this epic has found (Destinations' empty list, the North
 * Star's single input, and this).
 *
 * Pushed through `push_report_artifact`, which is the product's own write path: it allocates the
 * monotonic version under a lock and runs `private.report_artifact_payload_is_valid`, so a payload
 * this fixture accepts is one the API would have accepted. A direct insert would have bypassed both
 * and could seed a row the product can never produce.
 *
 * The payload is the SHAPE `buildPodReportView` reads (`lib/pod-report-view.ts`), with small honest
 * numbers rather than a copy of production's: `delivery.notInstrumented` is the one structural
 * requirement (`lib/pod-report-schema.ts`), and it is non-empty on purpose — the report's whole
 * argument is that the gaps ship beside the numbers, and a fixture declaring no gaps could not
 * exercise the panel that says so.
 *
 * No teardown counterpart: `test-db-cleanup.ts` deletes `report_artifacts` by project, and the
 * table deliberately has NO cascading FK (a project cleanup must not silently rewrite evidence a
 * shared link already rendered).

 * Mint a REAL share link for the fixture tenant, and hand its plaintext token back.
 *
 * ── Why this exists, and why a `coveredBy` string was not enough ──────────────────────────────
 * `/s/[token]` is the last route in the coverage manifest, and until Sprint 6 its row named
 * `e2e/report-share.spec.ts` as covering it. That spec has ZERO `page.goto` calls — it is an `api`
 * spec — so the label read as coverage and provided none. The row was inert only because it was
 * still `rendersFromDesignSystem: false`; flipping it would have added a route to the number with
 * nothing verifying it renders, which is the exact shape of the last epic's five deferred rows.
 * `sprint-6.md` names the fix and forbids the alternative: **mint a real token, do not reword the
 * string.**
 *
 * ── Inserted directly rather than through `mintShareLink` ─────────────────────────────────────
 * `lib/report-shares.ts` imports `server-only`, which a Playwright setup file cannot load. The two
 * halves that matter are pure and ARE imported: `generateShareToken` (the prefix and the entropy)
 * and `hashCredential` (the one hash for every credential in `api_keys`). So the row this writes is
 * the same row the product's own mint writes, produced by the same functions — not a hand-rolled
 * lookalike that could drift from it.
 *
 * Nothing is needed in teardown: `api_keys` is `REFERENCES projects(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`, and
 * teardown already deletes the project.
