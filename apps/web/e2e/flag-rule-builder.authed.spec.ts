// flags-visual-rule-builder · Sprint 1 QA.
//
// ── Why this is an `authed` browser spec and not an `api` one ─────────────────────────────────
// sprint-1.md asked for an api spec plus a `flag-rule-builder-dark.spec.ts` following
// `flag-serving-dark.spec.ts`. Both assumed a route. **This epic adds no route** (A1): the builder
// posts through the server action the textarea already used, so there is no endpoint for an api
// spec to call and no 404 for a dark spec to assert. Writing one anyway would produce a spec that
// passes without exercising anything — the "unreachable by construction" false green CODE-QUALITY
// rule 5 names.
//
// The coverage is therefore split where the code actually is:
//   • the pure seams — clause serialisation, basis-points conversion, cap-from-constant — are unit
//     tested against the REAL parser in lib/flag-rule-draft.test.ts and lib/rollout-percent.test.ts
//     (31 assertions, no browser, and mutation-checked).
//   • the gate's dark behaviour is asserted directly on the resolver in lib/flags.test.ts, via the
//     shared registry table: unset, exactly 'true', and nine near-misses. This is the
//     agent-rail-visibility precedent — a guard behind a session that the api project cannot reach
//     gets extracted and asserted, not tested through a surface the harness cannot log into.
//   • what neither of those can see — that the CONTROLS produce the right bytes — is this file.
//
// This spec replaces the browser smoke Sprint 1 owed the product owner for the 10%-means-1000
// check, which is the one step the epic README calls the most important in the whole build.

 * with the "New feature" wizard — which creates a plain on/off definition and cannot express the
 * arbitrary rules, rollouts and metadata these suites need as FIXTURES.
 *
 * The write itself lives in `helpers/seed-flag.ts`, shared with the Story 3.2 suite that needed the
 * same thing in the same story. Nothing about what these tests ASSERT changes — they are about how
 * a version RENDERS (its bars, its diff, its preview), and the surface that used to supply them was
 * never the subject.
 *
 * ⚠️ Stated rather than quietly swapped: this trades one thing away. While the textarea existed,
 * every one of these tests incidentally exercised it. It does not exist on the console any more, so
 * that cover is gone rather than moved — and the thing it covered is covered directly instead, by
 * `flag-console.authed.spec.ts`'s assertion that the form is absent with the gate on and by
 * `lib/new-feature-draft.test.ts` against the real parser.

// controls, deliberately: the fixture needs an arbitrary metadata entry (Story 2.3's fallback case)

// — and how the version got there was never what these tests assert. See `createVersion`.
// ⚠️ **Serial: these tests share one optimistic lock and `fullyParallel` splits them.**
// This file activates versions five times on the SAME tenant, and every activation reads
// `flag_environment_states.snapshot_version` and writes back expecting it unchanged. Split across

// other full run with "an ACTIVATED 10% rollout reads 10% on its bar, never 1000".

// ── Sprint 3 · Stories 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 — preview as a user ───────────────────────────────────
//
// sprint-3.md's QA asks for three contexts — one that matches, one that matches nothing, and one
// excluded by rollout — and says the parity assertion is the important one. Parity is pinned where
// it belongs, on the SDK, in packages/sdk/src/flags.test.ts: `explainFlagEvaluation(...).variantKey
// === evaluateFlag(...).variant` across thirteen contexts. What THAT cannot see is whether the
// answer survives the server action, the wire and the render, so this block computes each expected
// outcome with the SDK **in the spec** and asserts the page agrees.
//
// It also proves the read-only claim (Story 3.1's last criterion) the only way it can be proved:
// count the versions before and after.
