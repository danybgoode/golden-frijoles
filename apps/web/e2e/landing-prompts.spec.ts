// landing-redesign-v2 · Sprint 2, Story 2.2 — the prompts the landing hands to a reader's agent.
//
// ── The failure this exists to catch ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The landing's primary CTA is "copy this prompt into your agent". That prompt names URLs, and a
// URL inside a copied string is the least visible dependency this app has: nothing imports it, no
// type-checker sees it, no link-checker crawls it, and it breaks silently on somebody else's
// machine inside somebody else's model. `/northstar-self-serve.md` did not exist at all when the
// mockup was written — the CTA would have shipped pointing at a 404 and nobody here would ever
// have seen the failure.
//
// So every URL named in a prompt is fetched against this run's own base URL. This is only possible
// because `lib/landing-prompts.ts` takes `siteUrl` as an argument instead of hardcoding the
// production host — a literal would make this assertion untestable everywhere except production,
// which is everywhere it gets reviewed.

// ── The safety property of this whole surface, and WHERE IT NOW LIVES ────────────────────────
//
// The likeliest bad outcome from these prompts is not a wrong answer but a confident one about data
// the agent never had: a model telling its human "I can see your workspace" when nothing is
// connected, or "connect the MCP and I'll save your North Star" when the connector is read-only
// (AGENTS.md rule #3). Two assertions used to pin that sentence inside `handoffPrompt`, added after
// a cross-family review of PR #92.
//
// ⚠️ **`24220da` ("optimize hero copy", 2026-09-02) rewrote `handoffPrompt` and the sentence went
// with it** — so both assertions were RED on `main`, and on every PR opened after it, until
// `mockups-as-built` Sprint 1 tripped over them. Daniel confirmed the new copy is deliberate and
// stays.
//
// **The guard is re-pointed rather than deleted, because the property did not go anywhere — it
// moved one layer down.** The new `handoffPrompt`'s FIRST instruction is *"Read <site>/llms.txt"*,
// and `app/llms.txt/route.ts` carries it in full: *"Do not claim to be connected… Even once
// connected, the connector is read-only."* So the agent still receives it, from the document the
// prompt exists to load.
//
// Deleting these two tests would have been the easy read of "the copy changed". That is the move
// this repo keeps paying for — a guard "fixed" by weakening it until it matches whatever shipped.
// What is asserted is the PROPERTY, at its real home, plus the link that carries a reader to it.
