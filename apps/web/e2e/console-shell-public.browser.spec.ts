// console-ia-overhaul · Sprint 1. The PUBLIC half of the shell, asserted anonymously.
//
// ── Why this belongs in the anonymous project ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `/app/funnel/golden-frijoles/<key>` and its impact twin render `ProductShell` with NO session —
// they are the public showcase, allow-listed by `lib/public-demo.ts` (AGENTS rule #2). Every other
// spec for this shell needs credentials, so this is the one surface where the shell's behaviour is
// observable without any.
//
// ── The regression it exists to catch ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A revision of this epic keyed the console chrome on the env var alone. With the gate on, that gave
// this public page a logo, an EMPTY sections nav, an empty identity slot and a ⌘K palette listing
// nothing — console chrome for a viewer with no session to have surfaces for. Found by the fresh
// reviewer's third pass on PR #122, as a regression this epic introduced rather than inherited.
//
// The console is "an information architecture for the SIGNED-IN console". An anonymous visitor is
// not a degraded signed-in user, so the shell resolves no console header without a session — and
// this spec is what makes that true in fact rather than in a comment.
//
// ⚠️ **EVERY RUN IS THE DISCRIMINATING RUN NOW — mockups-as-built Story 3.3.**
//
// This used to be conditional and the conditionality was the point: `playwright.config.ts` set no
// `CONSOLE_SHELL_ENABLED`, the gate was born unset, so a plain `npm run test:e2e:browser` exercised
// the gate-OFF state — where no console chrome renders anyway and every absence assertion below
// passed against the PRE-FIX code too. The `Expected: 0, Received: 1` that proved this spec has
// teeth came from a `CONSOLE_SHELL_ENABLED=true` run, and the annotation below said so in the run
// output so a green could not be mistaken for the discriminating one.
//
// Story 3.3 deleted the flag. The shell now resolves a console header for every SIGNED-IN viewer,
// which is exactly the condition that could leak console chrome onto an anonymous page — so the
// regression is live in every configuration and the assertions below are load-bearing in all of
// them. The annotation is deleted rather than left to fire on a variable nothing sets: a note
// saying "this run proved nothing" printed on a run that proves everything is worse than no note.

  // ── The POSITIVE half, and it is the half that survives Story 3.5 ───────────────────────────

  // NOTHING. Story 3.5 deletes the signed-in legacy links, and if it takes the public chrome with
  // them this page would render an empty shell while a spec full of `toHaveCount(0)` stayed green.
  // So: a public visitor must still get public navigation. `Connect` and `Agent notes` both point at
  // genuinely public destinations (`/install`, `/llms.txt`), which is why they are the right two to
  // name here (fresh reviewer, PR #122, fourth pass).
  // Asserted on the DESTINATION, not the label. `getByRole('link', { name: 'Connect' })` passes if
  // the href is changed to a dead path, and what Story 3.5 risks is what a public visitor can still
  // REACH. `.ds-pubbar-nav` alone would be weak too — the console branch's tab nav carries that
  // class as well, so only these two links distinguish public chrome from console chrome.

  // ── ⌘K does nothing, and proving that needs a HYDRATED page ─────────────────────────────────
  // `networkidle` plus a fixed wait was the first version, and agy was right that it does not
  // establish hydration: if the keydown listener has not attached, the palette cannot open for a
  // reason that has nothing to do with this page being public, and `toHaveCount(0)` passes
  // trivially. That is the same hydration trap the authed spec hit from the other direction — there
  // a press before hydration made a real palette look absent.
  //
  // ⚠️ There is no client island on this page to wait on — and that is a FINDING, not an obstacle.
  // With no session the shell renders no palette, no rail and no agent rail, and the page's own
  // content is server-rendered, so an interactive marker does not exist to poll for. My first
  // attempt waited for a copy button that this page does not have; the spec failed loudly, which is
  // the right behaviour and worth more than the assertion I was trying to write.
  //
  // So the wait is on Next's own client runtime instead — `window.next` exists only once the
  // framework's JS has executed, which is the closest signal available on a page that deliberately
  // ships no interactivity of its own. After that a keypress is meaningful: any listener that WOULD
  // have been attached has been.
