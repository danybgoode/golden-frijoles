// agentic-pm-public-surface · Sprint 3, Stories 3.2 and 3.4 (epic D2).
//
// `lib/positioning.ts` exists so one category name and one definition reach five outward surfaces
// without being retyped on any of them. That is a claim about the SURFACES, not about the module —
// the module's own unit test cannot tell you whether anybody imported it, and four of the five
// could drift to a hand-typed variant while every existing spec stayed green.
//
// The RENDERED half. Its `api` sibling (`positioning-surfaces.spec.ts`) covers the two markdown
// surfaces; these three need a real page. NOTE: the `browser` project is not in the blocking gate,
// so this file must be run on purpose — `node scripts/run-local-e2e.mjs --browser`.
//
// So this asserts the round trip: the string in the module is the string a stranger reads. It is
// the guard that makes that module load-bearing rather than decorative, and `positioning.ts`'s
// header names this file by path — a promise this file has to keep.
//
// ── Why "identically" and not "mentions the category" ────────────────────────────────────────
// A near-copy is the failure mode, not an absence. Nobody ships a surface that forgets to describe
// the product; what happens is that one surface says "the whole product discipline" and another
// says "the entire product discipline", and the difference survives for a year because both read
// fine in isolation. Exact containment is the only assertion that catches that.

// The hero copy edit (24220da, 2026-09-02) took the definition off the landing on purpose, so this no
// longer asks for it there. What still holds: if it comes back, it comes back once. A definition
// repeated on one page stops being a definition and becomes a slogan.

  await page.goto('/')

  // ── The inherited constraint, and it is NOT re-litigated here ──────────────────────────────
  // `app/layout.tsx`'s DESCRIPTION took three review rounds to settle on naming no capability: a
  // link preview travels WITHOUT the qualification the page carries, gate state is per-deployment,
  // and this string is baked per-build — so any capability named here is a claim a flag flip can
  // falsify and the preview cannot qualify.
  //
  // The same rule is asserted on CATEGORY_DEFINITION by `lib/positioning.test.ts`. It is repeated
  // against the RENDERED metadata because that unit test checks the module, and this checks what a
  // chat app actually unfurls — which is the thing the rule was written about.
