// app-shell-and-agent-rail · Sprint 3 — Command Center, in a browser, with real numbers in it.
//
// ── design-system-rails · Sprint 5, Story 5.2 — this route is now **Today** (DD1) ──────────────
// Three of this file's assertions described the page that Story 5.2 replaced, and they are rewritten
// rather than deleted, because what each of them was DEFENDING still matters:
//
//   · the funnel on `/app`  → the approved `today` state has no funnel, and the funnel now has a
//     page of its own. **The non-zero check moved with it** rather than being dropped — it is the
//     single most valuable assertion in this file and the reason the file exists.
//   · the `.stat-card` grid → four `.ds-tile`s, one of which renders the honest never-recorded
//     North Star (sprint L1) rather than a number this product cannot produce.
//   · `.command-center__gaps` → still here, still asserted. The approved state has no such block,
//     and it is kept anyway: the Medusa-truth boundary has no other surface, and deleting a
//     capability to satisfy a geometry assertion is not what this story asks for (the same call
//     Sprint 4 recorded for Destinations' delivery logs).
//
// ── Why this spec insists on a NON-ZERO number ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// sprint-3.md calls this "not optional", and it is the single most valuable check in the sprint. A
// dashboard whose correct empty state is indistinguishable from its broken state is the bug class
// this repo shipped to production once: a query that silently requires a tag the realistic caller
// has no reason to set returns an honest-looking zero, and a zero pages nobody.
//
// A spec that only opened /app on a brand-new tenant would see the empty state, pass, and prove
// nothing — the funnel could be completely broken and it would still be green. So this drives real
// events through the REAL ingest path (`POST /api/v1/track`, the same wire contract the SDK sends,
// AGENTS rule #1) and then asserts a specific non-zero figure reaches the screen.
