// methodology-experience · Sprint 4, Story 4.1 — the reader becomes evidence.
//
// ── This reads the DATABASE, and that is the entire point ─────────────────────────────────────
// The story's acceptance is "the events carry a `feature_id` — assert it in the spec; do not assume
// it from the code". `commercial-shell` S3 shipped a landing beacon that wrote `feature_id = NULL`
// for its whole life: the events ingested perfectly, nothing errored, nothing alerted, and the
// funnel rendered a permanent zero because `lib/tars-query.ts` filters on that column. An HTTP-level
// spec asserting "the beacon returned 200" would have passed every day of that bug.
//
// The constants come from `lib/self-track-events.ts` rather than `lib/self-track.ts`: the latter
// starts with `import 'server-only'` and cannot be loaded by this runner at all. Comparing against
// a re-typed literal would be two lists that must agree, in the one spec whose subject is a mapping
// that was silently wrong in production for months.
//
// So this fires the real beacon and then reads the row back. A zero and a broken read are
// indistinguishable to a reader; a NULL `feature_id` and a working funnel are indistinguishable to
// every check except this one.

// The same expression `lib/self-track.ts` uses. Read here rather than imported because that module
// starts with `import 'server-only'` and cannot be loaded by this runner — the constraint that put
// the event vocabulary in its own file. A literal would be a third copy of the default.

 * A fresh `randomUUID()` visitor cannot collide with another tenant's rows, so this is not fixing a
 * leak. It makes the assertion STRONGER: without it, an event that landed on the wrong project
 * would still satisfy every test in this file. With it, "the beacon wrote an event" becomes "the
 * beacon wrote an event *to the self tenant*", which is the thing that actually has to be true —
 * `trackSelfEvent` resolves its tenant from `SELF_PROJECT_API_KEY`, and a misconfigured key would
 * silently write someone else's funnel.
 *
 * Raised by Codex in round 2 of PR #108 as a tenancy concern; taken for the stronger reason.
 * `lib/self-track.ts`'s own `SELF_PROJECT_SLUG` is the source of the slug, not a literal here.
