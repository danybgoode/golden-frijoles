// flags-console-parity · Sprint 1 Story 1.1 + Sprint 2 Story 2.1 — the console's dark path.
//
// ── What this file asserts, and what it deliberately does NOT ─────────────────────────────────
// Stated up front, because the epic's original QA plan for this spec was WRONG and correcting it is
// half the value here (epic README, Amendment 1).
//
// The plan was: "the gate-off byte-for-byte guarantee for 1.1, mirroring flag-serving-dark.spec.ts".
// That is not buildable. `/app/flags/[projectSlug]` is credential-gated, so the always-on `api`
// project — which has no session — sees a redirect to /login with the console ON *or* OFF. A spec
// asserting "the page renders as it did before" from there would pass for a reason unrelated to the
// flag, and would keep passing if the gate were hardwired to `true`. That is the guard-that-cannot-
// fail class LEARNINGS names, and an absent spec is better than one.
//
// What IS anonymously observable is the PER-FEATURE ROUTE, and only because of how it is written:
// `page.tsx` calls `notFound()` BEFORE `requireProjectMembership()`. So the two flag states produce
// two genuinely different anonymous responses:
//
//   gate OFF → 404            (dark means nonexistent, decided before auth)
//   gate ON  → 302/307 /login (the route exists; you simply are not signed in)
//
// That difference is real, is caused by the flag, and needs no session to see. So the coverage is
// split the way the agent-rail dark spec splits its own:
//   • FLAG POLARITY   → lib/flags.test.ts (born OFF, exact `=== 'true'`, full near-miss matrix)
//   • LIST ARITHMETIC → lib/flag-list-view.test.ts (the whole projection, filters, sorts, paging)
//   • ROUTE DARKNESS  → here, where it is genuinely reachable and genuinely flag-dependent
//   • RENDERED UI     → e2e/flag-rule-builder.authed.spec.ts (opt-in, needs a real session)
//
// ── Why the assertion branches on the live flag rather than skipping ─────────────────────────
// A `test.skip` when the gate is on would mean this file silently asserts nothing in a lit preview,
// which is exactly when someone most wants to know the route behaves. Both directions are real
// properties, so both are asserted, against whatever state this environment is actually in.

// Sprint 3, Story 3.4 — the two routes the console moves controls to. Both check the gate BEFORE
// auth, so an anonymous request sees the flag state directly, exactly like the per-feature route.
// This is the coverage Sprint 1's QA note promised and could not deliver: it had no gate-observable
// surface to point at, and now there are three.
// ⚠️ **THREE routes now — `/app/scheduled` joins them (design-system-rails S4.3).** It is the Ship
// rail's fourth item, built as a designed empty state, and it rides `flag-console` for the same
// reason the other two do: it sits beside Features and Activity, and a rail item that survived a
// console rollback would point at a page rendered by an epic that had been rolled back. Added HERE,
// in the commit that creates the route, rather than left for the sprint that notices — a gated route
// with no dark assertion is a gate nothing can observe.
// ⚠️ **`/app/flag-credentials` LEFT this list — design-system-rails S4.5.** It is a permanent
// redirect now, so it answers 308 in BOTH gate states and asserting a gate-dependent 404 on it would
// assert the opposite of what it does. Its replacement, Setup › Keys, is deliberately gated on
// nothing at all (it is the only surface that mints, so a closed gate would leave a project unable
// to issue any credential) — and `e2e/app-auth.spec.ts` asserts the redirect and its destination's
// auth boundary, which is the coverage that moved rather than the coverage that was dropped.
