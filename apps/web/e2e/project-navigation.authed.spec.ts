  //
  // `/app` used to end in a bare `<ul>` of every surface — a link literally captioned "Flags" and
  // another captioned "Tasks". The approved `today` state has no such list, because the shell's
  // section nav IS the navigation and a page that lists its own routes is answering "which URLs
  // exist" rather than "did anything need me today".
  //
  // So this asserts the same thing through what a person actually clicks now: the **Ship** tab,
  // which lands on Features, and the **band's own link** to the queue. Rewritten rather than
  // deleted — "a member can reach the live operating surfaces from /app" is still exactly the
  // property worth defending, and a spec that quietly stopped checking it would be the more
  // expensive outcome.

  // is already named in the top bar's switcher; repeating it in the h1 was the same fact twice, and
  // at 48px it wrapped to four lines on a real slug. What this spec actually cares about is that
  // the destination rendered its own page rather than an error or an empty shell — so it asserts
  // the heading AND that the list arrived, which the old title check never did.
