//
// ── Why this file exists, in one sentence ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Sprints 1 and 2 shipped a correct information architecture and a rejected visual result, and
// nothing in the plan could go red on the way a page looked: every acceptance criterion was
// structural ("the header renders one project switcher and four sections"), and the shipped build
// satisfies all of them while looking like a different product.
//
// The approved design is `design/flags-console-prototype.html`. It is the contract, not
// inspiration. These are the three numbers from `design/CONSOLE-CONTRACT.md` — the cheapest
// assertions that would have caught this on day one.
//
// ⚠️ Two of the three are pure geometry and hold for ANY dataset. The third counts rendered rows,
// so it is only meaningful against the prototype's dataset — which is why this spec SEEDS that
// dataset rather than asserting a number the fixture happens to produce. A row-count assertion
// against arbitrary data is a number that passes for the wrong reason.

//
// ⚠️ **This block used to open "NOTHING IN CI RUNS THIS FILE", and it was false for an entire
// epic.** `ci.yml`'s `e2e` job runs precisely this one spec — `--project=authed
// apps/web/e2e/console-visual.authed.spec.ts` — with all thirteen gate env vars mirrored, under a
// step whose own comment reads *"Story 3.3 landed; the gate is green; this is the step that was
// promised."* Story 1.6 rewrote this file and left the paragraph above it describing the world
// before that step existed.
//
// That is `CODE-QUALITY.md` #3 — a comment asserting a property the code does not have — sitting at
// the top of the epic's flagship guard, telling every reader that the guard does not run. Found by
// the fresh reviewer on PR #128. Corrected rather than deleted, because the reason it was written
// is still worth knowing: the file was deliberately NOT wired in at first, since assertion [1] was
// red until Story 3.3 deleted the JSON authoring stack, and wiring it earlier would have made CI
// permanently red. The replacement landed with the deletion, and so did the gate.

/**
 * ⚠️ **Exactly `'true'`, matching `lib/flags.ts`.** The first version skipped on truthiness, so
 * `FLAG_CONSOLE_ENABLED=false` did NOT skip — the string "false" is truthy — while the app read it
 * as off and served the legacy render. The suite then failed hard against markup it never claims to
 * describe (fresh reviewer, round 2).
 */
// ⚠️ **`CONSOLE_SHELL_ENABLED` is GONE from this predicate — mockups-as-built Story 3.3 deleted the
// flag.** Leaving it in would have been the worst possible outcome of that deletion: with the
// variable unset everywhere, `gatesAreLit()` is permanently false and THIS SUITE — the epic's
// flagship gate, the one thing that can go red on the way a page looks — would skip itself in every
// run and report green having asserted nothing. That is the exact failure this repo has recorded
// twice (`SIGNUP_ENABLED`, `FLAG_CONSOLE_ENABLED`), and it is worse here because the suite is the
// blocking gate rather than an opt-in rail.
//
// `FLAG_CONSOLE_ENABLED` stays: it is a real flag with a real dark state that CI asserts on the
// `:3100` server, and the exact `=== 'true'` comparison is what keeps `"false"` from reading as
// truthy the way it once did.

/**
 * ⚠️ **This gate does NOT seed, and the reason is worth keeping.**
 *
 * The design's claim is "42 features become 2 rows plus one line". Asserting that literally needs
 * the design's dataset, and I tried twice to install it:
 *
 *   1. Seeded 42 flags into the shared fixture tenant. `flag-rule-builder` went red on a rollout
 *      assertion that passes in isolation — 42 extra flags changed the world every other `authed`
 *      spec runs in, and `fullyParallel: true` means cleanup cannot help: another spec reads the
 *      tenant WHILE this one writes to it.
 *   2. Gave the gate its own project. `command-center` and `design-system` went red instead,
 *      because the fixture user then had TWO projects and `/app` lists them.
 *
 * Both are the same mistake: a test that needs a specific world, run against a shared one. The
 * literal "2" is also the PROTOTYPE's data — production is 3 serving / 39 never (A20), so the
 * number was never going to be portable.
 *
 * So the split is by what each layer can actually own:
 *   • the ARITHMETIC — how many rows for a given mix of states, and that grouping never loses or
 *     swallows a row — is unit-tested exhaustively over every combination in
 *     `lib/flag-list-view.test.ts`, where the dataset IS controlled;
 *   • the RENDERING — that the page turns that arithmetic into rows plus at most one summary line,
 *     and that the line stands for everything it hides — is asserted here, on whatever the tenant
 *     holds.
 *
 * What is lost, stated rather than hidden: no single assertion says "42 → 2 + 1" end to end. What
 * is gained is a gate that is true on every tenant instead of one, and does not make three other
 * suites lie.

// than on the assertion it exists to make, which is a red test proving nothing.

// was enforced by PROSE, which is the failure mode the contract was written to end (fresh reviewer,

// ── design-system-rails · Story 1.6 (epic D5) — the gate is DRIVEN BY THE MANIFEST ────────────
//
// Until now this file asserted ONE hand-written route. The manifest knows all 27, which routes have
// an approved reference state, and which claim to render from `apps/web/design-system/` — so the
// gate reads that instead of a list somebody remembers to extend.
//
// ⚠️ **An empty loop is the failure mode this whole epic is about**, so it cannot happen quietly:
// the routes this suite hands to a sibling spec are PINNED by name in `EXPECTED_SKIPS`, and every
// other claimed route is opened. In Sprint 1 nothing claims the design system, so the loop is empty
// — deliberately and visibly, and a row that claims coverage it has not earned fails here rather
// than inflating a percentage.
//
// An earlier version asserted a count against `coverage()`, which was the same predicate over the
// same rows and could not fail; the comment that described it survived two rounds after the code it
// described had gone (fresh reviewer, rounds 1 and 2).

/**
 * How to reach each manifest row in a browser.
 *
 * A row whose route has a second dynamic segment cannot be built from a slug alone — a feature key,
 * a journey key, a share token. Those return `null` and name the dedicated test that covers them,
 * because a generic loop that silently skipped them would report coverage for routes it never
 * opened. `every manifest row has a way to be reached` asserts this map covers every row, so a new
 * route cannot enter the manifest without someone deciding how the gate opens it.
 */
/**
 * Routes this suite deliberately does NOT open, because their URL needs a key or a token it must not
 * invent. Pinned rather than counted — see the assertion at the end of the loop.
 */
// ⚠️ **The journey and experiment DETAIL routes left this list — design-system-rails S5.**
//
// They were here because "their URL needs a key this suite must not invent", and their `coveredBy`
// strings named `journey-management.spec.ts` and `experiment-governance.spec.ts`. Both are
// `api`-project specs; `journey-management.spec.ts` does not open a page **at all** (zero `page.`
// references). So two routes counted toward the coverage number with nothing verifying they render
// from the design system — a `coveredBy` label that reads as coverage and provides none, which is
// the exact shape of the last epic's five deferred rows.
//
// The premise also stopped being true: Sprint 5's fixture seeds a real journey and a real
// experiment, so the keys are EXPORTED CONSTANTS rather than something to invent. Both are opened by
// the loop below like every other route, and the two hand-written claims are deleted rather than
// replaced by two better-worded ones.
// ⚠️ **`/s/[token]` LEFT THIS LIST — design-system-rails Sprint 6.**
//
// It was here because "its URL needs a token this suite must not invent", and its `coveredBy` string
// named `e2e/report-share.spec.ts` — which has ZERO `page.goto` calls. It is an `api` spec, so the
// label read as coverage and provided none. The row was inert only while it was
// `rendersFromDesignSystem: false`; Story 6.5 flips it, and a flipped row with an API-only claim
// behind it is the exact defect Sprint 5 found on four other rows.
//
// `sprint-6.md` names the fix and forbids the alternative: **mint a real token in the authed
// fixture and let this loop open the route. Do not reword the string.** `auth.setup.ts`
// (`seedShareFixture`) mints one with the product's own `generateShareToken` + `hashCredential`, so
// the token is not invented and the row it writes is the row the product's own mint writes.

  // ── An element selector inside a scope OUTRANKS the class named for the thing itself ─────────
  //
  // mockups-as-built Story 4.5 promoted `/s/[token]`'s title from `<p>` to `<h1>`, which put it
  // under `.ds .ds-pubwrap h1` — (0,2,1), two classes and an ELEMENT — while its own rule
  // `.ds .ds-sharehead-title` is (0,2,0). The element selector won, and the title rendered at
  // 30px/700 where the design draws 13.5px/600.
  //
  // ⚠️ **Every gate in this repository stayed green.** The structural contract counts BLOCKS and the
  // block was right; the measured spec runs on ONE route (`/app/flags`); the mobile sweep measures
  // overflow. A cross-family reviewer raised it as a Nit — *"verify the CSS does not rely on element
  // type"* — and measuring it turned the Nit into a real defect. This is the CLASS of that instance,
  // on every route this suite opens rather than the one it happened on.
  //
  // ── Two formulations were WRONG before this one, and both failures are the point ─────────────
  //
  // 1. **A static pass over `system.css` cannot decide it.** Whether two rules ever meet depends on
  //    which ELEMENT a class renders as, which lives in the components — the attempt produced 6,347
  //    pairs, almost all impossible (`.ds-btn` "conflicting" with `.ds-page-head h1`).
  //
  // 2. **Comparing the computed size against the declared one fires on the design working.**
  //    `.ds .ds-dialog--wide .ds-dialog-title { font-size: 16px }` is a legitimate ancestor VARIANT
  //    over `.ds .ds-dialog-title`'s 15px, and the element carries only the base class — so a
  //    declared-vs-computed check called 29 correct renders defects. A guard that fires on an idiom
  //    the repo already uses is how a guard gets switched off instead of fixed (LEARNINGS).
  //
  // What is actually asserted, and it is decidable: **of every rule that matches this element and
  // sets this property, the winner's SUBJECT is a class — never a bare element.** A `ds-` variant
  // beating its base is the design; a bare `h1` beating `.ds-sharehead-title` is the defect. The
  // browser has already parsed the stylesheet, so the cascade is read rather than modelled.

  // the thing this epic exists to delete: a hand-typed boolean per route saying whether it is
  // supposed to match yet, which is `rendersFromDesignSystem` with a new name.
  //
  // So the FLOOR is measured, not declared. `STATE-MATCH.json` is written by this test and
  // committed; a route listed there as matching that stops matching fails the build, and a route
  // that starts matching has to be committed as matching before it can regress. Nobody types which
  // routes are supposed to pass — the file records which ones DID, and the only editable direction
  // is forward.

  // re-ran the gate got a floor with that route silently removed — and the NEXT run passed. A
  // ratchet you can release by running it twice is not a ratchet, and it is the same shape as the
  // defect this epic exists to remove: a guard that reports success because its own input moved.
  // Found by mutation-checking it (delete a stat card from Ship › Features, run, look at the file).
  //
  // So a route that has ever matched STAYS in the file, keeps failing while it is broken, and can
  // only leave by a deliberate hand edit — which the `vanished` assertion below then has to accept.
  // ⚠️ **`regressed` is measured against what THIS RUN matched, never against the file being
  // written** (cross-family review, Codex, Blocking). It read `floor \ measured` where `measured`
  // was `floor ∪ matched` — a set that contains the floor by construction, so the difference was
  // ALWAYS EMPTY and the regression assertion could not fail. That was my own fix for the
  // floor-lowering hole two commits earlier, and it replaced a ratchet you could release by running
  // it twice with one that never held at all. In the epic about guards that cannot go red.
  //
  // The two jobs are now separate and both real: the FILE is a union (a route that has ever matched

  // floor by hand trips the `vanished` assertion. So 21/21 could never make coverage read complete,
  // and the epic's Definition of Done was arithmetically unreachable.
  //
  // Fixed at the source rather than by adjusting a number: the set of routes the gate is
