// console-ia-overhaul · Sprint 2. The two Setup surfaces, signed in.
//
// The `api` project can only see the dark 404 (`setup-routes-dark.spec.ts`). Everything the pages
// actually say — the honest connector status, the capability column, the member/owner boundary —
// needs a session, so it lives here.
//
// ⚠️ **IN the blocking gate since design-system-rails Sprint 5** — `ci.yml` runs the whole `authed`
// project, so the header's old "NOT in the blocking gate, run it by hand" is out of date.
//
// ⚠️ **`GATE_ON` is GONE — mockups-as-built Story 3.3 deleted `CONSOLE_SHELL_ENABLED`.** It read
// that variable and skipped the whole describe when it was unset; with the variable deleted from
// `ci.yml` and from `run-local-e2e.mjs`, leaving it would have skipped this file in every run
// forever. It is the only automated check on Setup's connector status, its member/owner boundary
// and its capability column. LEARNINGS: a suite outside the gate decays silently — and a suite that
// skips itself is outside the gate while looking like it is inside it.

// ── The owner-only boundary is asserted in `lib/setup-route-guards.test.ts`, NOT here ─────────

// second browser context through the login form hung on `page.goto('/login')` every time (the first
// context, from `storageState`, works fine; a hand-made one does not, even with `baseURL` passed
// explicitly). That is this repo's escalate-don't-hammer threshold.
//
// The property is asserted at the SOURCE instead, which is stronger than the browser test I was
// trying to write: a browser test proves one route 404s for one member on one run, while the source
// guard proves every owner-only Setup route calls `requireProjectOwnership` before it reads
// anything — and it cannot pass for the wrong reason (a 404 from a missing route, a stale session, a
// slug that never existed). Same shape as this repo's `getSiteUrl` caller registry.
//
// What remains uncovered, stated rather than implied: that the guard actually 404s a live member
// session end-to-end. `requireProjectOwnership` is shared with three routes that have shipped that
// behaviour since multi-tenant-activation, so this is a re-use of a hardened seam rather than a new
// boundary — but the end-to-end proof is Daniel's walkthrough step, and it is flagged as owed.
