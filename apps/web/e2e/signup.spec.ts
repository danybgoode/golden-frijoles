// multi-tenant-activation · Sprint 2 — Stories 2.1 + 2.2.
//
// READ THIS BEFORE ADDING AN HTTP SPEC HERE. The gate is OFF in CI and in local dev (it is born
// unset), so the ONLY signup behaviour an HTTP-level spec can reach is the 404. Everything past
// the gate — provisioning, slug collision handling, the owner membership — sits behind a real
// email round-trip this harness cannot perform.
//
// That is exactly the structural trap Roadmap/LEARNINGS.md records from S1: four HTTP specs
// asserting an open-redirect guard all passed against a DELIBERATELY VULNERABLE build, because
// the guard sat behind an auth precondition the requests never satisfied. The specs looked
// correct and CI was green, and the vulnerability was live.
//
// So the rule applied here: anything security- or correctness-critical downstream of the gate is
// extracted into a PURE, ZERO-IMPORT module (lib/tenant-slug.ts, lib/quota.ts's window maths,
// lib/flags.ts) and asserted DIRECTLY below — not inferred from an HTTP status that would be
// identical whether the logic were right or wrong.
