/**
 * ⚠️ `frame` exists because **the hub does not render `.ds-shell`** — design-system-rails Sprint 6.
 *
 * Its four routes are wrapped by `design-system/Frame`'s `hub` variant (`.ds-public--hub`), not by
 * `ProductShell`. Until this field existed they could be in NEITHER sweep: the public one is
 * anonymous and they need a session, and this one asserted a shell they do not have. The browser
 * sweep's own header claimed they "belong in the authed sweep, and `mobile-heuristics.authed.spec.ts`
 * is where that lives" — a statement about coverage that did not exist (fresh reviewer, round 7).
 *
 * The assertion is kept per-route rather than dropped: "a 200 is not proof of an authed route" is
 * what stops this suite measuring a login page, and each frame has its own proof-of-arrival.
