// design-system-rails · Sprint 4, Story 4.2 — the feature destination and its seven tabs.
//
// ── Why `.authed.spec.ts` when the sprint doc says `feature-tabs.spec.ts` ────────────────────
// A plain `*.spec.ts` lands in the `api` Playwright project, which has **no session**. Every route
// here is credential-gated, so an `api` spec would only ever see the redirect to `/login` and would
// assert the gate rather than the page — a suite that passes while proving nothing about what this
// story built. The `.authed` suffix is what puts it on the rail that signs in through the real form.
// Named as a deviation rather than left for a reviewer to spot the file is not where the doc says.
//
// ── What this covers that `flag-console.authed.spec.ts` does not ─────────────────────────────
// That file already pins the two ABSENCES: the Funnel and Impact tabs must not `notFound()`, and
// each must name which absence it is rather than render a zero. What it cannot cover is the other
// direction — that a feature which genuinely HAS a funnel renders NUMBERS — because the fixture
// tenant had no key registered in both registries. The auth fixture now seeds exactly one
// (`FUNNEL_FEATURE_KEY`), which is what makes this spec possible at all.
//
// ⚠️ **That asymmetry is the story, not a gap.** Production `miyagisanchez` holds 42 flag registries
// and exactly ONE TARS feature (`setup_guide`), and the two sets do not overlap — so 42 of 42 flags
// render the empty state, and the empty state is the deliverable (epic D10). The sprint contract
// puts the renders-numbers spec on a feature that has a funnel; `setup_guide` is production data CI
// cannot reach, so the local fixture carries the populated case, exactly as D10 assigns it.

/**
 * The tabs the NO-SCROLL promise applies to, and why the other three are exempt.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Named rather than dropped, and the exemption is the honest half.** The contract's "no vertical
 * page scroll at 1440×960" describes the pages the approved design covers. This story cites three
 * reference states — `feature-value`, `feature-environments`, `feature-funnel` — and those three
 * must fit.
 *
 * The other three are authoring and log surfaces the design does not draw:
 *   · `Targeting` renders the rule builder and "preview as a user" — measured at 2925px, and it is a
 *     form with a variable number of rules. A page whose height is the number of clauses somebody
 *     wrote cannot promise a fixed one.
 *   · `History` lists every immutable version with its JSON, and `Settings` every metadata key.
 *
 * Making them fit would mean paginating an authoring form to satisfy a geometry assertion, which is
 * the tail wagging the dog. What they DO owe — a `ds-` class inside `<main>`, a status under 400, no
 * HORIZONTAL page scroll, and exactly one current tab — is asserted for all seven below.
