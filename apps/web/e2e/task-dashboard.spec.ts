// signals-loop · Sprint 2, Story 2.2 — the task dashboard's ACCESS boundary.
//
// ── What this file asserts, and what it deliberately does not ────────────────────────────────
// The rendered UI (the queue table, the evidence drawer, the lifecycle buttons) is a `browser`
// project concern and needs a real session. What belongs in the always-on `api` gate is the
// boundary: an anonymous request must not read a tenant's task queue, and a slug must not become
// an existence oracle. Those are the properties whose failure is a security incident rather than a
// cosmetic bug, and they are assertable without a browser.
//
// Stating the split explicitly because LEARNINGS is clear that a spec which LOOKS like it covers
// the surface, but only reaches its edge, is worse than an absent one — the next reader stops there.
