// pod-report · Sprint 1 — the SIGNED-IN browser smoke for the hub.
//
// ── What this covers that the api project structurally cannot ─────────────────────────────────
// e2e/hub.spec.ts already asserts the hub's HTML over HTTP, but only for the DEMO tenant, because
// that is the one slug readable without a session (AGENTS rule #2). Everything a real customer
// sees — their own tenant, behind a real login, in a real browser — was previously only checkable
// by hand. That is precisely the "browser smoke owed to the product owner" WAYS-OF-WORKING says a
// browser spec is allowed to replace.
//
// The session comes from auth.setup.ts via storageState: a disposable user provisioned for this
// run, signed in through the REAL login form, and deleted by auth.teardown.ts afterwards.

// ── Read the fixture LAZILY, inside each test — never at module scope ─────────────────────────
// Playwright loads every spec file to COLLECT tests before it runs anything, including the
// auth-setup project that writes this record. A module-scope `readTenantRecord()` therefore always
// sees the file as missing, and a module-scope `test.skip(...)` on that value silently skips the
// entire file — which reports as a green run that asserted nothing. That is exactly the failure
// this rail exists to prevent, and it is how the first version of this file behaved.
//
// Reading at test time also means a missing fixture FAILS loudly rather than skipping: if the
// harness is invoked correctly, the record must exist, and its absence is a real problem to
// surface, not a condition to tiptoe around.

  // tenant with nothing pushed renders `head → list` where the design draws seven blocks, so the two
  // routes could not have matched their pictures for any amount of work on the pages.

  // Artifacts are append-only, so after any push the empty state is gone for that tenant forever.

  //     anonymously, and that tenant has an artifact by the time the suite runs.
