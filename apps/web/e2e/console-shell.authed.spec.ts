// console-ia-overhaul · Sprint 1. The signed-in shell, in a real browser.
//
// ── Why these assertions are HERE and not in the blocking `api` gate ──────────────────────────
// Every surface this sprint touches is credential-gated, so the `api` project only ever observes
// `/app` redirecting to `/login`, whatever the shell renders behind it.
// `flags-console-parity` Sprint 1 corrected exactly this mistake: a spec asserting "the header
// renders as it does today" from the api project is a guard that cannot fail.
//
// So the arithmetic is unit-tested in `lib/console-shell.ts` + `lib/console-palette.ts`, and what
// is left over — that the markup actually renders, that ⌘K actually navigates, and that the error
// boundary actually catches — is here. The boundary in particular has NO unit coverage and can have
// none: `node --test` cannot load `.tsx` and this repo has no component-test rail (probed, not
// assumed), so a browser is the only place its behaviour is observable at all.
//
// ── This project IS in the blocking gate since design-system-rails Sprint 5 ──────────────────
// `ci.yml` runs `--project=authed` with no file list, which is what closed the hazard the paragraph
// below was written about. LEARNINGS records that a suite outside the gate decays silently — a
// deletion-heavy epic invalidated five specs nobody ran for three review rounds.

// The palette's two selectors and its one fetch, named once. The path is READ from the component
// (`CommandPalette.tsx:102`); a spec that guessed it once already passed vacuously for a whole
// sprint (see the fetch-count test below).
const OPTION = '.command-palette [role="option"]'
const FEATURE_INDEX = '/api/internal/feature-index/'

// ⚠️ ⌘K is bound by a `useEffect`, so it does NOTHING until the island hydrates — and a keypress,
// unlike an assertion, is not retried by Playwright. Pressing once right after `goto` is a race:
// it passed three runs in a row and then a screenshot taken the same way caught the page with no
// palette on it, which is how this was found. Polling the press makes the spec test the palette
// rather than the hydration speed of the machine it runs on.
//
// Not a defect in the product: a person cannot out-type hydration on a page they just opened. It is
// a defect in a spec that would otherwise fail on a slow CI box and be dismissed as flake.
//
// ── It also waits for the LIST TO STOP CHANGING, which is a second race and a worse one ───────
// ⚠️ **The palette's rows arrive in two waves, and every measurement below was racing the second
// one.** `CommandPalette` renders the surfaces immediately and fetches the feature index on first
// open; when that lands, the features go in FRONT of the surfaces, so the row that was index 0
// becomes index 40 and React flips `aria-selected` on THE VERY NODE a test is holding, from `true`
// to `false`, in place. Nothing is wrong with the product — the cursor is still on row 0, which is
// now a different row — but a spec that resolved `nth(0)` before the wave and read it after sees a
// first option that is not selected.
//
// That is the CI-only failure of the cursor spec below: green on 3 CI runs and ~12 local ones, red
// on 4 consecutive CI attempts, with `Received: "false"`. Demonstrated rather than deduced — a
// probe that held the first node across the arrival read `heldSelected: "false"` on
// `palette-surface:journeys` while `nth(0)` had become `palette-feature:…`, which is the failure
// exactly. It is timing, so it belongs to the machine: a slower index makes it likelier, and no
// amount of re-running is evidence of anything.
//
// So the wait is HERE, in the opener every palette test shares, rather than at the one assertion
// that happened to go red first (LEARNINGS: fix the class). `awaitIndex: false` is for the one
// caller that reopens a palette which has already fetched — the fetch is once per page, and waiting
// for a response that will never come would hang that test for its full timeout.

//
// The fresh reviewer's S2 asked for an end-to-end guard on the state the original Blocking defect
// lived in: gate ON, a signed-in user with no project, exactly one sign-out control. It is not in
// this file, and that is a stated gap rather than an oversight.
//
// **What WAS verified, by hand, on 2026-08-27.** A version of this spec that removed the shared
// fixture's `project_members` row caught the defect: with `shell-nav.ts`'s zero-project branch
// reverted to its original `return EMPTY`, it failed with `Expected: 1, Received: 0` — the bug,
// observed. Restored, it passed. So the guard works; what follows is why it could not ship.
//
// **Why the shared-fixture form cannot ship.** Playwright runs spec FILES in parallel. For the few
// hundred milliseconds that row was missing, every other authed spec was pointed at a tenant with no
// member — and `flag-rule-builder.authed.spec.ts` went red in the full run while passing alone. That
// is the classic shared-fixture pollution tell, and a guard that breaks other tests is worse than no
// guard.
//
// **Why the isolated form is not here yet.** Creating a second auth user and driving the real login
// form in a hand-made `browser.newContext()` hung repeatedly (it does not inherit the project's
// `use` options; passing `baseURL` explicitly did not resolve it). Four attempts is this repo's
// escalate-don't-hammer threshold, so it stops here rather than absorbing more of the sprint.
//
// **What holds the property in the meantime, and it is not nothing.** The class is closed by
// construction rather than by observation: `shellRendersAccountMenu` is ONE predicate, the shell
// renders the menu when it is true and `/app` renders its line when it is false, and exactly one of
// those branches is taken for every input because they are complements of the same boolean.
//
// Its two inputs (`consoleEnabled`, `userEmail`) are independent of the arguments either caller
// passes — and what closes THAT is the parameter TYPE, which has no place to put a header, not a
// test. An earlier version of this comment said "pinned by lib/console-shell.test.ts"; the test it
// named could not fail and has been deleted (fresh reviewer, PR #122, third pass). Naming the wrong
// guarantor is the same defect as claiming coverage that does not exist, one level up.
//
// **What is therefore still uncovered:** that both call sites actually ASK that predicate. A future
// edit re-introducing a separate condition on either side would not be caught by any test here.
