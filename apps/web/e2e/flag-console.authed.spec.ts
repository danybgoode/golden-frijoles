// flags-console-parity · Sprint 3, Story 3.4 — the console's RENDERED surfaces, signed in.
//
// ── What this covers that nothing else could ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `flag-console-dark.spec.ts` proves the GATE: 404 dark, login redirect lit. It cannot prove the
// pages render, because the `api` project has no session and every one of these routes is
// credential-gated — it only ever sees the redirect.
//
// So this is the other half, and it was owed: Sprint 3 shipped two new routes and a rewritten list
// with no automated assertion that any of them render at all. The epic's own review found the same
// shape of hole twice (a spec left pointing at a moved surface, and three suites skipped rather than
// ported), which is the argument for writing this before the flip rather than after.
//
// Opt-in, like every `*.authed.spec.ts`: it needs a real session and a real Supabase, so it is
// outside the merge gate by design. Run it deliberately — `npm run test:e2e:authed`.
