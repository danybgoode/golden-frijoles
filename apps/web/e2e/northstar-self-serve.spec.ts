  // this test actually defends — every absolute URL in this document is built by `getSiteUrl()`,
  // never a hardcoded wrong-environment literal — and a count cannot tell you WHICH host it found.
  // It also left no room for citing a source, which Story 1.2 requires; cross-family review called
  // that Blocking twice, and the product owner amended the criterion rather than dropping the
  // credit.
