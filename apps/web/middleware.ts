// multi-tenant-activation · Sprint 1, Story 1.1 — auth session refresh.
//
// Server Components can't write cookies, so @supabase/ssr needs middleware to rewrite refreshed
// auth cookies onto the response. This is session PLUMBING ONLY — it does NOT gate routes.
// Per-route authorization is a server-side membership check at the DATA boundary
// (lib/membership.ts), never a URL-pattern guard here. Scoped to /app so the shipped public
// surface (landing, /api/v1/*) is untouched and pays no auth cost.

  let response = NextResponse.next({ request })

  // Auth env missing (e.g. a preview built before the vars land): skip the refresh — there's no
  // session to refresh without a client. This is NOT graceful degradation to a login screen: the
  // page's own getSessionUser() will then throw from requireEnv() and the request 500s. That is
  // deliberate and correct — a misconfigured auth boundary must fail LOUD, never silently render
  // as "logged out" (which could read as an authorization answer). An earlier comment here claimed
  // a /login fallback that the code never provided; cross-review round 2 (Codex, 2026-07-20) caught
  // the mismatch. The fix is the honest comment, not a softer failure.
