// app-shell-and-agent-rail · Sprint 2, Stories 2.2 + 2.3 — the agent rail.
//
// The backend has modelled the agent as an accountable actor since signals-loop: scoped revocable
// credentials, staged writes bound to the credential that proposed them, an append-only trail. None
// of it reached a screen. This is that screen.
//
// ── D4: this is RECENT ACTIVITY, and the copy is an acceptance criterion, not polish ──────────
// `recordAudit` swallows its own failure by design, so a successful revoke is never rolled back by
// a failed log write. Its own comment says so: "this trail is best-effort, not a ledger you can
// prove completeness against." Every string below respects that. Nothing here says "everything",
// "all", "complete" or "full history" — a rail claiming a completeness the data structurally cannot
// support would be the same failure as an artifact that lost its caveats, on the one surface whose
// entire pitch is that it shows its work.
//
// ── D8: the pending list is TASK-scoped, and says so on the surface ───────────────────────────
// `task_write_confirmations.task_id` is NOT NULL REFERENCES tasks(id). There is no staged row for a
// flag activation or a scenario launch. The section names what it covers rather than implying it
// shows every pending agent action. Generalising the mechanic is P2, not this bet.
//
// ── What this component must NEVER do ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// It never calls `consume_write_confirmation`. Reading a proposal here does not spend it — spending
// stays on the agent's path, under the agent credential the token is bound to (and it is a POST, so
// there is nothing on this read-only surface that could accidentally become one). The rail reads.
//
// Tenancy: both reads take the project id ProductShell resolved from the session user's memberships
// (lib/shell-nav.ts). No slug from a URL reaches this file.

const PENDING_LIMIT = 5

export async function AgentRail({ projectId, projectSlug }: { projectId: string; projectSlug: string }) {
  if (!shouldRenderAgentRail({ enabled: await isAgentRailEnabled(), projectId })) return null

  // Both reads return null — never [] — when they fail, and that distinction is carried all the way
  // into the copy below. "We could not read this" and "nothing is happening" are opposite messages;
  // rendering them identically would turn an outage into a calm, wrong reassurance.
  //
  // ── Why the try/catch, when both functions already return null on a query error ──────────────
  // (cross-review round 1, Agy on PR #72.) They return null for a *Postgrest* error. They can still
  // THROW: `getSupabaseServiceClient()` throws when SUPABASE_URL or the service-role key is missing,
  // and supabase-js can reject on a transport failure. An uncaught throw in a server component
  // fails the whole render — and this component sits in ProductShell, so one missing env var would
  // take down EVERY signed-in route rather than one sidebar.
  //
  // Catching to null lands in exactly the copy that is already written for an unreadable read. The
  // rail is an annotation on the page; it must never be the reason the page is gone.
  // `settleRailRead` lives in lib/agent-rail-visibility.ts, where a REJECTING read can be handed to
  // it directly — the epic shipped this guarantee stated and untested, which is the gap this closes.
