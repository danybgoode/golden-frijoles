/**
 * console-ia-overhaul · Sprint 1, Story 1.5 — ⌘K over every surface you are entitled to.
 *
 * ── The only client island in the shell, and it holds no logic ────────────────────────────────
 * What to show, in what order, and where the cursor goes all live in `lib/console-palette.ts`,
 * where `npm run test:unit` can reach them. This file is keystrokes and markup. That split is not
 * tidiness: `ProductShell` wraps every signed-in route, so anything asserted only from inside this
 * component is asserted only in a browser with a real session — which the blocking gate has neither
 * of.
 *
 * It is wrapped in `ShellErrorBoundary` by its caller, so a throw during RENDER removes the palette
 * and leaves the page (A9). That net does not extend to event handlers or to the native keydown
 * listener — see the boundary's own comment — so the listener guards its input directly.
 *
 * ── The SURFACES cost nothing, and the FEATURES cost nothing until you press the key ──────────
 * `links` are the ones `getShellNav()` already resolved server-side for the header and the rail.
 * That half is a second VIEW of a list the shell has already paid for, never a second READ — and it
 * therefore inherits the entitlement filtering rather than re-implementing it, which is the only
 * reason a client component may hold it at all.
 *
 * The FEATURES half (Story 3.4) is fetched from `/api/internal/feature-index/<slug>` on the FIRST
 * `⌘K` and cached for the life of this component. That is D7's answer, and it was measured rather
 * than preferred: the alternative — seeding from the server on every render — means paying the
 * registry's 5 round trips and ~16 KB on every signed-in page load to serve a control most sessions
 * never press. **`/app` route load cost is unchanged: zero added queries, zero added bytes.**
