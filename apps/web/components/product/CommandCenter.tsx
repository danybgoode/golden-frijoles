// design-system-rails · Sprint 5, Story 5.2 — Today.
//
// ── What this replaces, and why the replacement is the story rather than a follow-up ──────────
// `console-ia-overhaul` A25 left this route pre-contract: mono-italic caveats, a wide dead gap
// between the stat row and the funnel figures, a `<details>` of "what we are not measuring" and a
// bare `<ul>` of links under it. (That disclosure survived this epic in a reduced form and is gone
// for good as of `mockups-as-built` Story 2.4 — see the note where it used to render.) It was covered by no story in that epic, and half-doing it left a
// route that is neither the old page nor the approved one. Sprint contract #8 makes it this story.
//
// ── DD1: Today gains its missing third band ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A task's real states are `open | claimed | resolved | dismissed`. Today already asked one question
// in two registers — "waiting on you" and "what changed" — which are the two ENDS of that lifecycle
// with the middle missing: the part where something has picked a task up and is working it. That
// middle is where the agent this product sells is visible at all, and until now there was nowhere
// in the signed-in product it could be seen working (audit §2.5).
//
// `/app/tasks` is the same three bands mounted as its own page (DD5). The band components live in
// `design-system/bands.tsx` so there is one implementation rather than two that currently match.
//
// ── Every read fails SOFT, and each tile says which nothing it is showing ─────────────────────
// Today is the page every signed-in session lands on. A single failing read must degrade to one
// unreadable tile, never to an error page — and, just as importantly, must not degrade to a **zero**,
// which is the honest-looking failure this repo has shipped before and has four LEARNINGS entries
// about. Each `catch` below returns `null`, and `null` renders the sentence naming the absence.

          but it "has no other surface in the product". That argument is the one this epic exists to
          overturn: it was a builder deciding, after shipping, that the approved design was wrong.

          Daniel's call, 2026-09-09, asked as an explicit either/or: DELETE it. The reasoning is
          worth keeping — it is CONTENT, not a control, so nothing stops working, and the honesty
          boundary it described is not lost with it. `lib/pod-outcome.ts` still enforces in code that
          this engine never claims a commerce figure it does not have, `pod-outcome.test.ts` still
          pins that, and `/llms.txt` still states the read-only boundary to any agent that reads it.
