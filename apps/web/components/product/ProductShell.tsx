/**
 * Product chrome is rendered inside each page after its auth/flag guard resolves.
 *
 * This must not become an App Router layout: Next may stream a parent layout before a child calls
 * `notFound()`, turning the required dark-route 404 into a 200 with not-found content. Keeping the
 * shell below the guard makes the HTTP status and the visual rail agree.
 *
 * app-shell-and-agent-rail · Sprint 1, Story 1.3 — the section nav.
 * console-ia-overhaul · Sprint 1, Story 1.3 — the four-destination header. It was behind a flag;
 * mockups-as-built Story 3.3 deleted the flag, so it renders for every signed-in viewer.
 *
 * `projectSlug` is the page's own project, passed so the sections point at the project you are
 * actually looking at. It is a HINT, not an authorization input: lib/shell-nav.ts matches it
 * against the membership list it reads server-side and ignores anything that does not match, so a
 * slug in a URL can never make this render another tenant's sections.
 *
 * ── `section` is REQUIRED, and that is the point (epic README, A8) ────────────────────────────
 * Next.js gives a Server Component no pathname, and the alternative — a client island calling
 * `usePathname()` — is the one thing this file's comments forbid twice: the shell wraps every
 * signed-in route including error and gated states, so a client island here would be the single
 * component able to break all of them at once.
 *
 * So each page declares where it lives. Making the prop required rather than optional turns "every
 * page belongs to a section" into a compile error at all 26 render sites (18 files) instead of a convention that
 * decays the first time someone adds a route. `home` is `/app` itself, and it has to be said out
 * loud rather than achieved by leaving the prop off.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT gated by AGENT_RAIL_ENABLED (app-shell-and-agent-rail README, D6). A rail can be
 * born off and flipped on; navigation that vanishes with a flag is a worse failure than no flag.

    // which is the bug this shell already paid for once (see the `header`/`consoleEnabled` note).
    // ⚠️ **`ds` is what makes the design system PAINT here, and Sprint 3 is where it arrives.**
    //
    // Sprint 2 scoped every rule in `system.css` to `.ds .ds-…` — deliberately, because
    // `console.css`'s `.is-console main p` at (0,1,2) was out-specifying bare `.ds-*` rules at
    // (0,1,0) and stripping the primitives' own colours. `.ds .ds-x` is (0,2,0) and wins.
    //
    // The consequence nobody had hit yet: `is-console` alone gets the TOKEN VALUES
    // (`tokens.css` is scoped `.ds, .is-console`) and NONE of the primitive paint. A `ds-env`
    // button on the console would have rendered as an unstyled `<button>` with correct colours
    // available and none of them applied — valid markup, no design.
    //
    // So the two classes mean two different things, and both are needed:
    //   `is-console` — this is the console: tokens, and `console.css` applies.
    //   `ds`         — this subtree renders FROM the design system: `system.css` applies.
    // Sprints 4–6 assemble pages from `design-system/primitives`, and this is the line that lets
    // them. See **D3** (the design system's classes are namespaced: prefix `ds-`, scope root `.ds`).
    //
    // ⚠️ This cited "D15", which does not exist — the epic's decisions run D1–D14. Invented in a
    // comment whose own contract line is "Cite a decision; never re-derive one" (fresh reviewer).
    //
    // ⚠️ **AND THE TWO ARE NO LONGER ONE CONDITION — design-system-rails Story 5.3.** The paragraph
    // above already argued that `is-console` and `ds` answer different questions, and then set both
    // from `header !== null`, which answers only the first. That coupling was invisible until a page
    // body rendered from the design system on a route that has no console header:
    // `/app/funnel/<demo>/<key>` and its impact twin are ANONYMOUSLY readable (`lib/public-demo.ts`'
    // allow-list, AGENTS rule #2), so `getShellNav` returns `EMPTY`, `header` is null — and Story
    // 5.3's rebuilt panes would have rendered every `ds-` class with no `.ds` ancestor: valid
    // markup, correct colours available, none of them applied. Exactly the failure the paragraph
    // above describes, arriving from the other direction.
    //
    // So each class is set by the question it actually answers:
    //   `ds`         — this subtree renders FROM the design system. True wherever this shell renders,
    //                  because the page body inside it does, session or no session.
    //   `is-console` — this is the console: `console.css` applies, and the console chrome is there.
    //
    // Those two anonymous demo dashboards are the ONLY renders this changes, and they are precisely
    // the two routes Story 5.3 rebuilds — verified by enumerating the allow-list. Nothing else
    // reaches this component without a session.
    // ⚠️ **TWO elements, and the nesting is required rather than stylistic.**
    // `system-cascade.test.ts` asserts that every selector in `system.css` is `.ds` itself or a
    // DESCENDANT of it — a compound `.ds.ds-shell` scores the same (0,2,0) and still fails, because
    // the guard checks the structural form rather than re-deriving specificity per rule. Rather than
    // widen a guard that has already caught two real defects, the shell says the two things
    // separately: this subtree renders from the design system, and inside it is the shell.

          ── D4: the gate-off branch below is UNTOUCHED, and that is auditable ───────────────────
          `header === null` means the console chrome does not apply to this render — the gate is
          unset, OR there is no session (the two demo dashboards render this shell anonymously), OR
          `getShellNav` degraded. All three want the same public/legacy chrome. It is ONE field, and
          the account menu below reads the same one, so the chrome and the menu cannot disagree about
          whether this is a console render.

          ⚠️ **This branch is no longer the pre-epic markup, and Story 3.5 is why.** Sprints 1 and 2
          kept it byte-identical so `git diff` could check the dark-launch guarantee; that guarantee
          has been discharged — the console has been LIVE in production since Sprint 2 (A19) — and
          3.5's whole content is the reduction below. What it is now is the PUBLIC chrome: a logo,
          `Connect`, `Agent notes`, and the project signal.

          ⚠️ **THE FLAG IS GONE AND THIS BRANCH IS NOT — mockups-as-built Story 3.3.** A16 already
          said why: `header === null` stopped meaning "the gate is off" in Sprint 1. Two states reach
          this branch permanently and neither was ever about the flag — an ANONYMOUS viewer on one of
          the two demo dashboards, and `getShellNav`'s catch. Deleting the branch along with
          `CONSOLE_SHELL_ENABLED` would have taken the public bar away from every anonymous reader
          and dropped a signed-in operator into nothing on an outage. It is the public chrome, and it
          is reached by two conditions that have nothing to do with a flag.

          ── One honest qualification, because "unchanged" was too strong ──────────────────────
          This BRANCH is byte-identical. The DATA it renders is not: Story 1.2 removes `funnel` and
          `impact` from the inventory unconditionally (D3), so with the gate off the Sections
          disclosure lists eleven surfaces where it listed thirteen. That is the intended change —
          both were nav entries whose own description told you to edit the URL — but `git diff` on
          this file cannot show it, and the guarantee was being stated absolutely. Neither dashboard
          loses its only entry: `CommandCenter` still links both with a real feature key. Raised by
          the fresh reviewer on PR #122.

                It used to be painted by `globals.css`'s `.product-shell__header`, a 64px grid with a
                fixed bottom tab bar on phones; those rules were the "old world" this Sweeper
                deletes, so the branch that rendered them had to land somewhere. DD3 already said
                where: *chrome appears when there is something to navigate*, and this render — an
                anonymous visitor on a demo dashboard, or `getShellNav`'s catch — has a mark and two
                links. That is the public bar exactly.

                Two things get FIXED rather than merely moved, and both are recorded because "no
                pixel changes" is this story's own claim and these are the exceptions to it:

                    `vocabulary.ts` since Sprint 2 and owed to "Sprint 3". It is sentence-case
                    Archivo now, and its debt entry is deleted with the rule.
                  · the links were a FIXED bottom tab bar below 640px. A two-item bottom bar pinned
                    over the content of a page a stranger is reading is chrome that outweighs what it
                    navigates. They sit in the bar at every width. */}

                  **`Home` and the `<details>` disclosure are deleted** (epic README, A16). What
                  remains is the PUBLIC chrome, and that is the whole point of the reduction.

                  `Home` was safe to delete because its destination is duplicated: `BrandLockup`
                  above links `/app` in both branches, so this loses a LINK, not a route.

                  The `Sections` disclosure required `activeProject`, which requires a session — so
                  it never rendered anonymously, and its deletion is signed-in-only by construction.
                  The one state that lost it was "signed in with the console gate off", which no
                  longer exists at all since Story 3.3 deleted the flag; the console's own
                  four-section nav is what replaced it.

                  ⚠️ **`Connect` and `Agent notes` STAY, permanently.** This branch is what an
                  anonymous visitor to the two demo dashboards gets — they have no session, so no
                  console header — and it is their ONLY route to `/install` and `/llms.txt`. Story
                  3.5 as originally written would have deleted them along with "the now-dead
                  gate-off branch"; A16 corrected that, and `console-shell-public.browser.spec.ts`
                  asserts both hrefs so the correction cannot be undone by someone tidying up. */}

                {/* ⚠️ THIS HREF STAYS `/install`, and reverting it here is Story 2.2's actual fix.
                  (Fresh reviewer, PR #123, Blocking.)

                  A previous revision pointed this at `/app/setup/connect/<slug>` whenever a project
                  was resolved. This is the PUBLIC branch: it renders when `header === null`, which
                  is an anonymous viewer or `getShellNav`'s catch. An anonymous viewer has no project
                  and no session, so pointing them at a member-gated Setup route sends them to a
                  login redirect from a bar whose whole job is to work without one — and `/install`
                  is the page that actually answers "how do I connect this".

                  ⚠️ The original reason was sharper and is worth keeping as history: the route's
                  first statement used to be `if (!isConsoleShellEnabled()) notFound()`, so with the
                  gate unset — its production value at the time — every signed-in operator clicking
                  `Connect` got a hard 404 on a link that had worked before that epic. Story 3.3
                  deleted the flag, so that particular 404 is unreachable now; the anonymous case
                  above is why the href still does not move.

                  The console branch has no Connect link at all — `Setup › Connect your agent` in the
                  rail is the destination — so on every signed-in path this line is not reached.

                  ⚠️ It is NOT satisfied "by construction", and an earlier version of this comment
                  said it was. There is one path where the gate is on and this branch still renders:
                  `getShellNav`'s catch, which cannot know whether a session exists (`getSessionUser`
                  is the first thing inside its `try`) and therefore returns the PUBLIC chrome. So
                  during a Supabase outage with the console lit, a signed-in operator can reach
                  `/install` from here and copy the demo project's connector URL.

                  That is a wrong-tenant confusion, not a leak — rule #2 means `/install` only ever
                  serves the demo project — it is bounded to an outage, and it is exactly what
                  happened before this epic. It is left alone deliberately: the alternative (console
                  chrome from the catch) puts console chrome on the public demo dashboards — a logo,
                  a lone Today tab and an empty palette (measured; the switcher and account menu are
                  already suppressed by `EMPTY`'s null project and null email). Still wrong for a
                  public page, and the worse trade of the two. Fixing it properly means
                  narrowing that `try` so a session read failing is distinguishable from a nav read
                  failing, which is a change this sprint does not need to make.

          ⚠️ **This was inside the 54px top bar, and the approved design has TWO tiers.** Measured on
          the running console before touching anything: `.ds-shell-header` was 1440x54 with the
          tabs nested inside it at 289x43 — one bar carrying everything. The prototype's `#sectionnav`
          is a SIBLING of `.topbar`, a 1440x44 row with its own background and bottom border.

          Nothing caught it, and this is why: `MEASURED-SPEC.md` carries "Section nav (tier 2)
          1440 x 44" — generated from the prototype — but `console-gate-spec.ts`, the array actually
          asserted against the PRODUCT, has no row for either tier. The number was measured, written
          down, published in a contract, and never compared to the thing it described. Both tiers are
          in the gate now.

          Rendering it only when there are tabs keeps the gate-off and anonymous branches unchanged:

            Decided by Daniel, 2026-08-28, closing CONSOLE-CONTRACT.md's Do-not #4 — which the epic
            had left open ("a decision the epic never made, and it must be made explicitly rather
            than inherited"). The rail is in none of the ten approved reference states, and inside
            the console grid it squeezed the content column to 544px against the approved 1180,
            which is why every table clipped.

            ⚠️ **`header !== null` is the console, and after A19 that is every signed-in /app route.**
            So this condition does not merely narrow the rail — it retires it from the signed-in
            product. `activeProject` requires a session, and an anonymous visitor has none, so the
            remaining branch renders nothing in practice. Said plainly because the honest version of
            this change is "the agent rail is gone", not "the agent rail is conditional".

            That is a control removed, so the ordering rule applies: what did it carry, and where
            does each thing live now? It carried the agent's recent activity and its waiting-on-you
            queue. The approved design gives both a destination — **"What changed & why"** in the top
            bar — which is a real place rather than a deletion. Building that is the replacement, and
            until it exists this trades a squeezed console for a missing surface. Flagged rather than
            filed as done. */}
