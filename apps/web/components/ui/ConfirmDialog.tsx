// app-component-kit-adoption · Sprint 1, Story 1.2 — the one confirmation in the product.
//
// `references/ux-guidelines.md` has required this since the design handoff: "Destructive or
// hard-to-reverse actions get a second, explicit confirmation naming what's about to happen and
// that it can't be undone — never a bare 'Are you sure?'". The requirement was written down and
// never built. This is it. (The guidelines name the BEHAVIOUR — they never named a component; the
// epic README's reuse table said otherwise and was corrected at kickoff.)
//
// ── Why a native <dialog> and not a hand-rolled overlay ───────────────────────────────────────
// Focus trapping, `Esc` to dismiss, inerting the page behind, and the top layer are all things the
// platform does correctly and a hand-rolled version gets subtly wrong — usually by trapping focus
// everywhere except the browser chrome, or by leaving the background scrollable. `showModal()`
// gives all of it. What is left for us is the part the platform has no opinion about: which control
// is focused when it opens, and whether dismissing counts as acting.
//
// ── Why NOT window.confirm ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// It blocks the page and the automation harness — recorded in destination-manager.tsx when the
// two-click confirm was added there (Codex cross-review round 12), and it is why this epic can spec
// the cancel path at all.
//
// ── D5 (corrected at kickoff): this is never wired to the agent rail ──────────────────────────
// `components/product/AgentRail.tsx` renders a read-only list of STAGED AGENT PROPOSALS. Those are
// a different mechanism answering a different question: a `task_write_confirmations` row is a
// durable authorization that the AGENT spends later via `consume_write_confirmation`, under the
// credential it was bound to, possibly in another session. This component is a transient question
// asked of the HUMAN at click time, and it authorizes nothing beyond the click. Different actor,
// different lifetime. They are not two implementations of one idea and must not be merged.
// (The refining docs claimed the rail "already confirms". It has no interactive controls at all.)
