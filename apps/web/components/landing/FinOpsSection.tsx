// landing-maker-ops · Sprint 2, Story 2.6 — AI unit economics. finops · Sprint 3, Story 3.4 — now LIVE, and it says
// only what /app/finops shows.
//
// Until finops shipped, this was the one section describing something that did not exist, with four invented figures
// in a deliberately un-StatCard-like treatment. The figures are GONE, not swapped for real ones: a landing page has no
// reader's data to show, and borrowing our own numbers would be a reading presented as the reader's. What is left is
// the mechanism, stated in the present tense because it runs:
//
//   1. The status still comes from the registry (`lib/landing-sections.ts`, now `live`), never from a string here.
//   2. Every claim is one /app/finops or the build view can show: measured from Claude Code sessions (metrics only),
//      a quote calibrated from your own shipped epics, an alert when spend passes it — alert only, nothing is stopped
//      (finops D8) — and Claude Code only, said outright (D12).
//   3. The one part still unbuilt — cost linked to the North Star movement it bought — keeps a `next` badge of its
//      own, in words, inside the panel. The section is live; that sentence is not, and it says so.

          Every epic gets a quote when it is refined, calibrated from what your own shipped epics actually
          cost. While it is built, the build view shows spend against that quote; at close the actual is
          stamped into the epic, so the next quote is better. Push your usage and FinOps in the console breaks
          it down by epic, skill and model.
