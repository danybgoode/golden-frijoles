// landing-maker-ops · Sprint 2, Story 2.5 — agents move, authority stays put.
//
// ── The icons ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The mockup fills each activity row's icon slot with a bare capital — `<i>A</i>`, `<i>✓</i>`,
// `<i>R</i>`, `<i>S</i>`, `<i>E</i>`. The tick is a `check` glyph the drift guard rejects outright
// (`ui-pictograph`), and the four letters are the "I placeholder" pattern that
// `landing-frijoles-rebrand` already removed from this page once. Every row here takes a real
// `Icon`, and every row renders through `ActivityFeedItem` — the single device for agent activity
// in this codebase, shared with the signed-in rail, so the landing and the product cannot drift
// into two different pictures of the same thing.
//
// ── Both panels still READ their gate; only the prose under them is gone ─────────────────────
// The drills' two gates are OFF in production today, and so is the connector's write path. Each
// panel used to carry a computed sentence saying so underneath its activity feed. Those sentences
// were cut in the readability pass, and the qualification did NOT go with them: each panel's badge
// is still resolved from the live flag, so a gated capability is still labelled as gated and the
// label still disappears on its own the day the gate opens (epic D3). What is gone is the second,
// longer statement of the same fact — not the fact.
//
// `e2e/landing.browser.spec.ts` checks this against the real routes rather than against the flag,
// and it was re-pointed at the badge in the same commit.
