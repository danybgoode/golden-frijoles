// landing-maker-ops · Sprint 2, Story 2.4 — the server half of the Ops panel.
//
// This component exists to do one thing the client half cannot: read the gates. Both flags are read
// fresh per request (`app/page.tsx` is `force-dynamic`, so this is a real read on every load rather
// than a value frozen into the build), and the resolved status travels down as a prop.
//
// That split is what keeps epic D3 true. Flip `RESILIENCE_SCENARIOS_ENABLED` and
// `SECURITY_SIMULATIONS_ENABLED` on in production and the SecOps "partly gated" line disappears by
// itself, with no edit here, none in `maker-ops.ts`, and none in the client component. Nobody has
// to remember, which is the only reliable kind of correctness for a claim on a public page.
//
// ── This is now the ONLY place the surfaces are derived, and it must stay that way ────────────
// Moved here from `MakerHero.tsx` by agentic-pm-public-surface Sprint 2, which deleted the hero's
// kraft bag. The reasoning travels with the derivation rather than being deleted with the markup,
// because it is what stops someone re-introducing the defect it was the fix for:
//
// The bag once carried a HAND-WRITTEN list of the four surfaces, parallel to `MAKER_OPS_SURFACES`.
// That duplication cost three separate review findings which were all the same defect — a gated
// capability listed without its qualification, found once per surface, because fixing one list
// never reached the other (SecOps in round 4, DevOps in round 5, after this panel itself in round
// 3). A badge on the third one would have been the third patch for one root cause.
//
// Deriving instead makes the class unrepresentable (CODE-QUALITY #2): a surface cannot be qualified
// in one place and bare in another, because there is one list and one status resolution. If a
// second surface on this site ever needs to name these capabilities, it imports `maker-ops.ts` and
// resolves the gates per request. It does not write them down.
