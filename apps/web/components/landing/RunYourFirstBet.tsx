// landing-maker-ops · Sprint 2 — the page's primary action, in one place.
//
// A server component, so `isSignupEnabled()` is read fresh per request rather than baked into a
// build. That matters here for the reason AGENTS.md rule #4 spells out: Vercel snapshots env vars
// into a deployment at build time, and a CTA whose destination was decided at build time would keep
// pointing at a 404 for as long as the deployment lived after the gate was flipped.
//
// No `variant` prop. It had one — `'gold' | 'ghost'`, defaulting to gold — and all four call sites
// used the default, so it was an unexercised branch shipped on the assumption someone would want it.
// This IS the page's primary action; a ghost version of it would be a different, softer ask, and the
// decision to offer one belongs to whoever needs it, along with the reasoning for where. Flagged by
// Mistral Vibe in round 11 of PR #100.
//
// `label` is gone too, for the same reason and one epic later. It existed for §methodology, which
// asked the reader to explore the method while there was still only one place to send them — so the
// label changed and the destination stayed this component's. `methodology-experience` Story 2.4
// gave that section a real destination (`/methodology`), which left `label` with no call site. A
// prop kept alive by nothing is an unexercised branch shipped on the assumption someone will want
// it; when the section that needed it stopped needing it, it went with it.
