// landing-redesign-v2 · Sprint 2, Story 2.5 — ⑩ Pricing. Replaces WaitlistSection.tsx.
//
// ── The $49 tier ships WITH its price and WITH the fact that you cannot pay it (epic D1) ──────
// The mockup prices "The Beanstalk" at $49/mo. There is no payment rail in this product — no
// checkout, no subscription, no metering that bills. Three options were on the table and the
// product owner chose the middle one: ship the price anchor the design needs, and say plainly in
// the tier itself that billing is not live yet, with the CTA pointing at the same real free signup
// everything else does.
//
// That is not hedging. CODE-QUALITY.md #9 requires every claim on a public surface to be
// checkable, and a price with no way to pay it fails that in the most expensive possible place —
// the reader discovers it after signing up, having already decided we round things up. A stated
// "not billable yet" costs a sentence and buys the rest of the page's credibility.
//
// ── The free tier follows the live flag, exactly as the page it replaces did ──────────────────
// `isSignupEnabled()` is read fresh per request. With the gate off there is no `/signup` route to
// send anyone to, so the tier renders the waitlist form instead of a button into a 404. Note the
// event limits below are the ones the tier DESCRIBES, not a quota this code enforces — real
// per-tenant ceilings are data (`projects.monthly_event_quota`), not env and not copy.
