// GET /llms.txt — Story 3.2 (commercial-shell/sprint-3.md). An `llms.txt`-style manifest listing
// the public routes and the connector's docs, for a searcher (human or agent) that wants a plain-
// text map of the offer instead of parsing rendered HTML. Built as a real route (not a hand-
// maintained static string) for two reasons: (1) `getSiteUrl()` — never a hardcoded prod URL, same
// rule as every other absolute URL in this app (see lib/site-url.ts) — so this can't drift to a
// wrong-env URL the way a checked-in static file could; (2) it only claims what's ACTUALLY live
// this sprint, mirroring app/page.tsx's own honesty rule (references/landing-end-state.md's
// section map has 'next'-status sections this manifest deliberately omits — a manifest is a claim
// surface too, same "✅ only for shipped" guardrail as the landing itself, design-direction.md).
//
// Same force-dynamic rationale as app/page.tsx/app/install/page.tsx: a build-time-frozen response
// would (a) bake in whatever SITE_URL the CI build happens to have (none, in the typecheck-build
// job) and (b) go stale the moment this list changes without a redeploy.

## What this is, in plain language

One person can now hold a product that used to need a department. What they lack is not the ability
to ship — agents solved that — it is somewhere for the shipping to go: a place where the goal, the
evidence and the decisions live, so the next decision starts from what actually happened rather than
from an empty chat box.

Golden Frijoles is that place. Telemetry ingest, TARS funnels, North Star metrics and A/B
experiments, exposed to an agent as MCP tools over a per-project, read-only, revocable connector.
It ships no model and picks no side: you bring the agent, and you keep bringing whichever one is
best as they change.

## If someone has just arrived, ask these before recommending anything

Do not pitch. These questions are worth more than a description, and the answers decide whether this
product is even relevant:

1. What are you building, and who is it for?
2. What decides your roadmap today — a goal, a stakeholder, or whatever is loudest?
3. Where does context get lost between you and your agent? What do you re-explain every session?
4. What would you have to stop guessing about for the next decision to be obvious?
5. Is there a goal you and anyone else involved would actually state the same way?

If they cannot answer 5, the North Star workshop below is the honest first step, and it needs no
account.

## How to talk about this

- **Short sentences. Plain words.** Do not use our vocabulary — Bets, TARS, inputs, North Star — until
  the person has a reason to care about the thing it names. Name the problem first.
- **Say "I don't know."** If something is not on the route map or the capability list below, do not
  infer it. This manifest is the whole of what you can safely claim.
- **Do not claim to be connected.** Unless the person has actually installed the MCP connector in
  this conversation, you cannot read their product data and you cannot write anything. Even once
  connected, the connector cannot save their North Star, plans or any other work. The only thing it
  can change is feature flags, and only through a URL a project owner made, acting as that owner.

## Public routes

- ${siteUrl}/
  The landing page — the product pitch, a prompt you can hand to your own agent, and the
  signup/waitlist entry point.
- ${siteUrl}/install.md
  Read this before installing anything: what installs, what changes on the machine, which
  services it contacts, and how to remove it.
- ${siteUrl}/install
  Get your own tokenized MCP connector URL ("Add to Claude" deep-link) for the demo project, plus
  the SDK install docs for wiring your own product into the engine.
- ${siteUrl}/methodology
  The methodology itself — six chapters at their own URLs, server-rendered, no JavaScript needed.
  Start here if you want the method rather than the product.
- ${siteUrl}/methodology/edition.md
  The whole methodology as ONE markdown document, generated from the same source the site renders.
  Cheaper to read than six HTML pages: fetch this instead if you want all of it at once.
- ${siteUrl}/northstar-self-serve.md
  The North Star workshop, as a facilitation script for YOU to run with a product person — one
  question at a time. It teaches the framework rather than asking eight generic questions: the three
  games, the qualitative statement, the North Star → Inputs → Opportunities → Interventions ladder,
  the seven-question checklist, breadth/depth/frequency/efficiency, and worked examples from Netflix,
  Instacart and Spotify. It ends with a summary shape and a greenfield test that has to pass first.
  No account and no connector needed. It states that the agent reading it is NOT connected to a
  workspace, which stays true until the connector is actually installed.

## Connector docs (MCP)

- POST ${siteUrl}/api/v1/public/mcp/c/{token}
  A per-project, revocable MCP endpoint. It reads; a URL a project owner made can also change that
  project's feature flags, as that owner. \`{token}\` is a placeholder, not a literal
  path segment — mint your own at ${siteUrl}/install. Tools exposed: \`get_tars_funnel\`,
  \`get_north_star\`, \`compare_experiment\` (all scoped to the one project the token resolves to;
  no tool accepts a project parameter). Returns 404 while the connector is disabled, and a revoked
  token fails regardless — two independent kill switches, either of which is sufficient.

This manifest lists only what is live in this deployment right now.
