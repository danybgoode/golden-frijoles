// multi-tenant-activation · Sprint 1, Story 1.1 — the code-exchange landing. Supabase links back
// here with a `code`; we exchange it for a session (setting the auth cookies) and send the user on.
// Redirect base comes from getSiteUrl() (AGENTS rule #5 — never the request Host header).
//
// `next` is attacker-controlled — the origin-comparing guard lives in lib/safe-redirect.ts as a
// pure, zero-import function so it can be asserted directly by the e2e suite (this route only
// consults `next` after a successful code exchange, so an HTTP-level spec can't reach that branch).
//
// Sprint 2, Story 2.1 extends it: a successful exchange is also the moment an email is CONFIRMED,
// so this is where a self-serve tenant gets provisioned. Sign-in confirmations flow through here
// too — which is exactly why provisionTenantForUser is idempotent on membership: an existing
// member arriving here gets `created: false` and nothing is written.
