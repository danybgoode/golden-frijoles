// multi-tenant-activation · Sprint 1, Story 1.1 — the authed shell. Unauthed → /login; a signed-in
// member sees EXACTLY their own projects (getUserProjects is a service-role read of the
// membership join table — never derived from the URL).
//
// design-system-rails · Sprint 5, Story 5.2 — this route is **Today** (DD1). Two things changed
// beyond the render:
//
// 1. **It shows ONE project, not a stack of them.** The console chrome names a single tenant in its
//    switcher, and the page under it used to list every project the viewer belongs to — so the
//    header and the body disagreed about whose numbers were on screen. That is the quiet kind of
//    mismatch a person acts on without noticing, and it is the same class the shell's own
//    foreign-slug rule exists to prevent (`lib/shell-nav.ts`).
// 2. **The switcher now switches.** Every project's Today entry used to resolve to the bare `/app`,
//    so on the one page where the switcher is most useful it was a menu of N links to the page you
//    were already on — Story 4.1's own rule, "a control that goes nowhere is worse than no control",
//    measured on the home page. `todayHrefFor` carries the slug.
//
// ⚠️ **The slug is a VIEW preference, never a tenant selector.** It is matched against the viewer's
// own membership list — read server-side from the session — and anything that does not match falls
// back to their first project. A hand-typed `?project=` therefore reaches nothing it could not
// already reach, which is AGENTS.md's rule: the request never selects the tenant.
//
// ⚠️ The fallback is deliberate HERE and would be wrong on a route addressed by tenant.
// `getShellNav` refuses to fall back for a supplied slug, because on `/app/funnel/<slug>/…` the
// chrome and the `<main>` would then name different projects. `/app` is not addressed by tenant at
// all, there is no foreign data to show, and 404-ing the home page over a stale bookmark would be a
// worse answer than showing the reader their own default. The RESOLVED slug is what reaches
// `getShellNav`, so it never sees a slug the viewer is not a member of.

            It used to test the console flag directly, which is a DIFFERENT question: the shell
            also needs a resolved header and an email, and a signed-in user with no project (say,
            `/app?provision=failed`) has neither — so the gate being on suppressed this line while
            the shell fell back to the legacy header that has no account menu, leaving the page
            with no way to sign out at all. Found by the fresh reviewer on PR #122.
