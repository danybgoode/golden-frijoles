// multi-tenant-activation · Sprint 2, Story 2.3 — the first-run screen a freshly confirmed
// signup lands on: the one-time key reveal, a ≤5-line SDK snippet pre-filled with it, and (gated)
// the MCP connector URL. Everything on this page must be actionable from on-screen steps alone —
// that's the story's acceptance bar, not just "renders something."
//
// ── design-system-rails · Sprint 5, Story 5.6 — reference state `setup-connect` ────────────────
// It was the last route in `/app` still drawn entirely in inline styles: `font: '700 12px
// var(--mono)'` step labels, a hand-rolled `<pre>`, `.panel` and `.btn-gold` from the LANDING's
// stylesheet, and a 34px `.display` heading. Every one of those is a decision made once, on this
// page, that nothing else shares — which is the condition this epic exists to end.
//
// It is now assembled from the same primitives Setup › Connect uses: `PageHead`, `Card`, `Steps` /
// `Step`, `CopyField`, and `ShownOnce` for the one-time key. **`ShownOnce` is exactly what this
// page needed and did not have** — it was built in Sprint 4 for the key reveal on Setup › Keys, and
// the two surfaces now say "this is the only time you will see this" in one voice.
//
// ⚠️ It stays `flow-only` in the inventory and is still gated out of the nav. It gets a reference
// state because a person can REACH it, not because the nav lists it.

// lib/provisioning.ts's registerStarterFeature), imported rather than re-typed so the two can
// never drift apart. That drift is not cosmetic: lib/tars-query.ts filters events by
// `feature_id = <featureKey>`, so an event whose featureId doesn't match a registered feature
// key produces a funnel that renders an honest, permanent zero.
