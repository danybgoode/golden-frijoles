// design-system-rails · Sprint 5, Story 5.6 — reference state `measure-scenarios`.
//
// ── Audit §6.4 is the finding this closes, and §7 P1 is why it is here ────────────────────────
// *"Today this is a read-only log where the PRD describes a tool."* The page opened on a workspace
// of every run, every security result, every impact snapshot, every breaker policy and every trip —
// nine tables, chronological, with no answer at the top. It now opens on the question a person
// arrives with: what held, what failed, and what has never been run.
//
// ⚠️ **An untested control is an assumption**, and that is the one figure this page adds that the
// old one could not show: `neverRun` has its own tile and its own row state, because a drill nobody
// has run is not a passing drill. `splitGeometry` refuses to draw its 0/0 split for the same
// reason — "everything held" over nothing sent is unrepresentable here, not merely avoided.
//
// The workspace is kept in full behind a disclosure. It is the operating surface for a live drill —
// evidence, breaker policies, trips — and it has no other home.
