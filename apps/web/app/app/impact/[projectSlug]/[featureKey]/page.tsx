// Growth Engine v1 · Sprint 3, Story 3.4 — the per-feature input-impact report. Behind per-tenant
// authorization (multi-tenant-activation Story 1.2) — same gate as /app/funnel: demo is anonymous,
// every other slug requires a signed-in member.
//
// ── design-system-rails · Sprint 5, Story 5.3 — reference state `measure-north-star` ──────────
// The manifest maps this route to `measure-north-star`, and the mapping is an ARCHITECT's call
// recorded there: the approved Measure rail opens on "North Star", the product has no
// `/app/north-star` route, and this is the only route that renders the North Star and something
// moving against it. So this page IS that state, feature-scoped.
//
// ⚠️ **THE HERO IS EMPTY, BY CONSTRUCTION, AND THAT IS THE DELIVERABLE** (sprint L1).
//
// The approved state opens on a big number and a fourteen-week plot. This product cannot produce
// either: `readNorthStar` in `lib/pod-report-query.ts` returns `latestValue: null` unconditionally —
// its own comment says "deliberately reports a LEVEL and never a trend" — and the schema has no
// table to read a level from at all (`north_star_metrics`, `leading_inputs`, `input_values`, and
// `input_values` belongs to an INPUT). Drawing a number here would mean inventing one.
//
// So the hero renders the sentence, and the plot renders why there is no plot. An empty state is one
// of the nine and is a deliverable, not a fallback (epic D10). The half of the design that this
// product CAN fill — *What fed it*, the inputs' real series as small multiples — is filled, by the
// same `ImpactPane` the feature page's Impact tab renders (DD5).
//
// ProductShell now reads the session cookie on every render (lib/shell-nav.ts), so this route is
// request-time by nature. Declared rather than inferred: LEARNINGS records a feature gate's required
// 404 turning into a 200 when a parent streamed, and an implicit-dynamic route is the same class of
// surprise — the behaviour should be in the file, not in a rule about generateStaticParams.
