// design-system-rails · Sprint 5, Story 5.4 — reference state `ship-experiments`.
//
// ── What changed, and what deliberately did not ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// The page was an authoring form above a `<table>` of versions, headed "Experiment governance". It
// is now the approved list — one row per experiment, with its state and its primary metric — and
// **the authoring surface is kept, in full, behind a disclosure**. Creating a draft, binding a flag
// version and transitioning a version are real capabilities with no other home, and deleting one to
// satisfy a geometry assertion is not what "render from the design system" asks for (the same call
// Sprint 4 recorded for Destinations' operational logs).
//
// ⚠️ **Readiness is resolved for RUNNING versions only, and it is CAPPED** — see
// `lib/experiment-list-view.ts`. "Ready to decide" is a property of the ANALYSIS, and the analysis
// is a full fact scan per experiment; a list page must not silently become N of them. Past the cap a
// row reads `unresolved` and the answer line says so, because "we did not look" and "it is not
// ready" are different sentences and only one of them is a measurement.
//
// On production `miyagisanchez` both experiments are `decided`, so this page runs **zero** analyses.

  // Two bugs live in this one line's history, and the second was only visible on a rendered page.
  // First, `.at(-1)` under a comment claiming the array was ascending — `mapExperimentRegistryRows`
  // sorts DESCENDING, so it picked the OLDEST. Then, taking the highest number — which put
  // **Draft · v2** on a row whose v1 was RUNNING, hiding a live experiment behind an unstarted plan.
  //
  // `describingVersion` answers the question the page is for: the newest version that has actually
  // started, with a newer draft flagged beside it — the same model the journeys list uses, which is
  // what the approved design means by "same row, same state pill, same version words".
