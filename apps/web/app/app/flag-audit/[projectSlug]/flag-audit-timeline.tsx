// design-system-rails · Sprint 4, Story 4.3 — the activity feed, as SENTENCES.
//
// ── Why this replaces a `DataTable` ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The approved `ship-activity` state is a timeline, and its own copy says why: *"everything anyone
// has done to a feature in this project, newest first — written as sentences, not as rows of a table
// nobody reads"*. Seven columns of `when · feature · what changed · version · environment · reason ·
// who` is a table you scan for a value you already know the name of; a sentence is what you read
// when you are asking *what happened here*, which is the question this page is opened with.
//
// Nothing about the DATA changed. Every field the table rendered is here — the version, the
// environment, the reason and the external actor included — arranged so the subject, verb and object
// are one line and the qualifiers sit under it.
//
// ── It is a SERVER component now ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `DataTable` is a client island (its filter and sort are `useState`), so the old table shipped
// JavaScript to render a read-only list. There is no interaction left to pay for, so this ships
// none — and the words become readable by the merge gate rather than only by a signed-in browser.
//
// ⚠️ The filter box goes WITH the table, and that is a real loss, stated rather than glossed. It was
// a client-side substring match over the rendered cells. The honest replacement is a URL-backed
// filter like the feature list's, which is a story nobody has written; the audit is newest-first and
// bounded by what `getFlagRegistryView` returns, so scanning it is not the same problem as scanning
// 42 features. Named here so the next reader knows it was removed on purpose.
