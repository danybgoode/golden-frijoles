// flags-console-parity · Sprint 3, Story 3.2 — the lifecycle audit gets its own place.
//
// ── MEMBER-readable, and that is load-bearing ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `requireProjectMembership`, NOT `requireProjectOwnership`. The audit is member-readable on the
// flags page today, and the story is explicit: "moving it must not quietly make it owner-gated."
// That is the easy mistake here — the credentials route next door tightens to owner-only, and
// copying its shape would silently take the audit away from every member. Ownership is right for
// credentials because listing keys is privileged; it is wrong for an audit, whose whole purpose is
// that the people affected by a change can see who made it.
//
// ── Why the actor pairing matters ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `externalActorId` is the verified caller from a scoped external control plane (Miyagi's Clerk).
// Rendered ALONGSIDE the Golden owner, never instead of it: "owner X via Clerk user Y" is what makes
// a Miyagi-initiated flip attributable to a person rather than to a service account.
//
// ── A4 / D1: no query is added ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `getFlagRegistryView()` already returns the audit rows the flags page renders. This selects the
// same array onto its own route.

            names a place, the page names what is on it. `design-system-rails` Story 4.3 renamed the

            uses"; half of that was right and the other half was never checked against the picture.
