// flags-console-parity · Sprint 2, Story 2.1 — one feature, in its own place.
//
// ── Why a route rather than a modal ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Flagsmith uses a modal; this uses a URL. The epic's outcome test is answered by SHOWING someone a
// screen, and a modal has no address to send. A per-feature URL is linkable in a Slack thread, in an
// incident note and in the lifecycle audit — which is most of what "its own place" is worth.
//
// ── Gate: dark means nonexistent, before auth ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Same shape as every gated route in the product (`app/app/journeys/[projectSlug]/page.tsx`): the
// flag check runs BEFORE `requireProjectMembership`, so while the console is dark this segment 404s
// for everyone rather than leaking its existence through a login redirect. This is the assertion
// Sprint 1's corrected QA note promised the `api` Playwright project could actually make.
//
// ── A4 / D1: no query is added ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `getFlagRegistryView()` already returns every definition, version and activation for the project.
// This page selects ONE row out of what the list page already reads. There is no per-flag fetch.
