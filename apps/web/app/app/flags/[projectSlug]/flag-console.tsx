// Ship › Features — the list, and the environment it answers about.
//
// ── design-system-rails · Sprint 4, Story 4.1 — this page BODY now renders from `design-system/`
// It did not before, and the distinction is the whole value of the coverage number. Sprint 3 put
// every console route inside the design system's frame; this is the first sprint where a page's own
// markup is assembled from `design-system/primitives` instead of from `console.css`'s port of the
// prototype. The classes that painted it (`.is-console .listcard`, `.row`, `.stat`, …) are DELETED
// in this same commit — never as a cleanup story, because with the console live a missing rule is
// noticed the day it goes missing (sprint contract #11).
//
// ── This is a SERVER component, and that is the design, not an omission ───────────────────────
// Every control here is a `<Link>` or a plain GET `<form>`, so search, filters, sort AND the
// selected environment all live in the URL — a filtered view can be bookmarked, shared, and
// survives a refresh. Client state cannot provide that. The page ships no JavaScript for any of it.
//
// ── Why this is not `DataTable` (flags-console-parity D4) ────────────────────────────────────
// `DataTable` is a client island whose search and sort are `useState`. Routing this list through it
// would put the filters back in client state and break the bookmarkability above. So the BEHAVIOUR
// is different and lives here, while the VISUAL language is shared — from the design system now,
// rather than by reusing another component's class names.
//
// ── The shape asserted, never the literal 2 (sprint contract #1) ─────────────────────────────
// The design's claim is "42 features become 2 rows plus one line". That is the PROTOTYPE's dataset.
// Production `miyagisanchez`, queried 2026-08-29: 42 flags, 3 active in Production, 39 never
// activated, 0 deliberately off — so live it is 3 rows and one line standing for 39. What is
// asserted is the SHAPE: rows plus at most one summary, and the summary standing for rows that are
// not also listed. The arithmetic is pinned exhaustively in `lib/flag-list-view.test.ts`, where the
// dataset is controlled.
