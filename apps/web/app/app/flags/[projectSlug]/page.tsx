 * disclosure, so a reader who filtered from the grid would land back on the grid with a filter that
 * the grid does not render.

            ── What the head says, and why (each a Do-not in CONSOLE-CONTRACT.md) ──────────────
            The TITLE is "Features". It was "Feature flags — <slug>", which at 48px wrapped to four
            lines on a real tenant slug and spent ~200px before any content. The project is already
            named in the top bar's switcher.

            The SUBTITLE no longer describes STORAGE (Do-not #7). "← Your projects" is gone with it:
            the top bar's switcher is the way back.

            ── design-system-rails S4.1 — TWO page actions now, which is what the design has ────
            "Compare environments" was missing because there was no comparison surface, and a
            previous head shipped it as a button pointing at this same page with the filters reset —
            a control labelled as a feature that does not exist. `FlagCompare` is that feature, and
            the button lands with it. */}

        {/* With the gate OFF this renders exactly what it rendered before the epic.
            `flag-manager.tsx` takes ONE optional prop, `showDefinitions`, defaulting to `true`, so
            the gate-off render is unchanged. The console is an additional tree, not a rewrite of the
            one below it.

            ── Why this is NOT gated on `canManage`, stated here because two review passes asked ──
            "Key" means two different things on this page, and the boundary follows the second one.
            A FLAG key (`checkout.stripe_enabled`) is a definition identifier and is deliberately
            MEMBER-READABLE — `getFlagRegistryView` is documented as exactly that. An API key (a
            snapshot or catalog-sync credential) is operationally sensitive, and THOSE are what
            `canManage` gates.

            `<FlagConsole>` renders strictly LESS about a definition than the stack below it already
            showed members, which included every version's full JSON. So gating it on `canManage`
            would not tighten any boundary — it would newly HIDE member-readable data from members.

            Cross-review (Codex) raised this as Blocking in two consecutive rounds. It was wrong both
            times, but a finding a reader reaches twice is a readability defect in the code, not just
            a reviewer error — so the distinction is written down here rather than re-argued. */}
