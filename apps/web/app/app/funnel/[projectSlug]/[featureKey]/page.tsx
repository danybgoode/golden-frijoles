// Growth Engine v1 · Sprint 2, Story 2.3 — the funnel page for a registered feature
// (v1's headline case: /app/funnel/miyagisanchez/setup_guide). Behind per-tenant authorization
// (multi-tenant-activation Story 1.2): the demo project renders anonymously; every other slug
// requires a signed-in member (unauthed → /login, non-member → 404).
//
// ── design-system-rails · Sprint 5, Story 5.3 — reference state `funnel-standalone` (DD5) ─────
// It rendered a `<dl>` of three numbers. It is now the SAME `FunnelPane` the feature page's Funnel
// tab renders, wrapped in the page chrome a standalone route needs: a crumb back to the feature, a
// head, and the answer line the approved state opens with.
//
// **One design, two mounts — and it is one because there is one component, not because two of them
// currently agree.** The page's own words say so out loud, which is the design's answer to "why does
// this exist if the tab does the same thing": the URL is shareable, and the tab is where you will
// actually find it.
//
// ProductShell now reads the session cookie on every render (lib/shell-nav.ts), so this route is
// request-time by nature. Declared rather than inferred: LEARNINGS records a feature gate's required
// 404 turning into a 200 when a parent streamed, and an implicit-dynamic route is the same class of
// surprise — the behaviour should be in the file, not in a rule about generateStaticParams.

          <strong>This page is a view of a feature, so it also lives on the feature.</strong> The link is
          shareable and the tab is where you will actually find it — same design, two mounts, not two designs.
