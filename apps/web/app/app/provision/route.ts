// multi-tenant-activation · Sprint 2 — the provisioning RETRY, as a Route Handler.
//
// Why this exists at all: the auth callback provisions a tenant after the email round-trip, but
// `signInWithPassword` (app/login/login-form.tsx) sets its cookies client-side and NEVER reaches
// /auth/callback. So a user whose provisioning hit a transient error at confirmation time had no
// path back — a working account, no tenant, and nothing that would ever retry (cross-review,
// Codex 2026-07-20).
//
// Why a Route Handler rather than doing it inline in the /app Server Component: a Server Component
// cannot write cookies. Retrying inline therefore could not hand over the plaintext key, which
// forced a "provision without a first key" mode — and that mode then silently skipped the starter
// feature too, leaving retried tenants with a permanently empty funnel (cross-review, Agy
// 2026-07-20). A Route Handler can set cookies, so the retried user gets the IDENTICAL experience
// to a first-time signup: key reveal, starter feature, onboarding screen. The special case is gone
// rather than patched.
