// pod-report · Sprint 3, Story 3.1 — the share-link lifecycle server actions.
//
// Structurally the same as the API-key actions next door, and deliberately so: minting a link that
// shows a tenant's internal delivery data to an outsider is credential administration, not an
// ordinary member action. Every entry point re-checks OWNERSHIP server-side and scopes the mutation
// to the resolved project_id, so a member of one project cannot touch another's links by passing a
// foreign slug or row id (LEARNINGS: a role column is not an access rule — one gate per privilege
// LEVEL, which multi-tenant-activation S1 had to be told twice).

// Server Actions are a public HTTP surface and TypeScript types are erased at runtime, so every
// argument is validated as a real string before use.
