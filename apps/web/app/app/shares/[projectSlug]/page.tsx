            The approved head carries a primary action, and that control shares one piece of state
            with the mint form and the shown-once URL: whether a bearer token is on screen right now.
            `keys-surface.tsx` made the same move one surface over, for the same reason.

            ⚠️ **The lede's second paragraph MOVED rather than being deleted** (Story 4.6, kept). It
            said every lens keeps the report's caveats and its "not instrumented" rows — a promise
            about what a narrower lens does NOT hide — and it belongs where the lens is chosen. It is
            the hint on the audience field now. */}
