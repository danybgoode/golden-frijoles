// Setup › Share links — mint, list, revoke.
//
// ── design-system-rails · Sprint 4, Story 4.6 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
// This shipped as bare markup: a `<fieldset>` of radios, three unstyled `<label>`s and a raw
// `<table>` with a `colSpan` empty row. It was the last surface in Setup rendering nothing from any
// system at all, and it is a CREDENTIAL surface — a share link is a bearer token that renders this
// project's Pod Report to whoever holds the URL.
//
// It now renders from `apps/web/design-system/`: the same rows, the same pills, the same one-time
// reveal and the same copy field as Setup › Keys, so an operator who has revoked a key already knows
// how to kill a link. That was the stated intent of the original file; it is true of the pixels now
// rather than only of the data model.
//
// ── Its own `formatUtc` is GONE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A four-line private copy, written to avoid `toLocaleString()`'s hydration mismatch (the server
// formats in its zone, the browser in the reader's — caught by both cross-review families). The
// reasoning was right and the seam already exists: `lib/format-utc.ts` does the same thing and
// additionally returns a readable string where the copy threw a RangeError on a bad timestamp.

 * empty one. Revoked rows are still LISTED here, unlike credentials on Setup › Keys: a share link's
 * whole risk is that somebody out there has the URL, and the record of having killed it is what an
