// signals-loop · Sprint 2, Story 2.2 — the task queue, for humans.
//
// ── Why this page exists at all, when the point of the epic is agents ────────────────────────
// "Humans see what agents see" is the acceptance criterion, and it is a trust requirement rather
// than a convenience. An agent claiming and resolving work against a queue nobody can inspect is
// unauditable by construction — the first time someone asks "why did it close that?", the answer
// has to be a page, not a database query. This renders exactly what `list_tasks` returns, from the
// same functions, so the two surfaces cannot drift into disagreeing about a tenant's own queue.
//
// ── design-system-rails · Sprint 5, Story 5.6 — it is Today's bands, at full length (DD5) ─────
// It used to be a four-column `<table>` with a `▸`/`▾` toggle in a cell. The approved design has no
// such thing, and the reason is not taste: a queue is not a fifth place to look, it is the MIDDLE of
// Today — the part where something has picked a task up — mounted as its own page so it can show the
// two closed states Today collapses into one band.
//
// The row itself is `design-system/bands.tsx`' `TaskLine`, the same component Today renders. What
// differs is the `actions` slot: Today links here, and here you can claim, resolve and dismiss.
// **The interactive half is untouched in substance** — the actions, the evidence pointer field and
// the evidence drawer all survive, because deleting a capability to satisfy a geometry assertion is
// not what "render from the design system" asks for.

  //
  // Both fail SOFT. A refresh hiccup must degrade to a slightly stale queue, never to an error
  // page: someone opening this during an incident needs the list they have, not a stack trace.
  //
  // ⚠️ Today does NOT do this, deliberately. `/app` is a read surface that every session lands on,
  // and running two write paths on it would make the home page a mutation trigger — which is a
  // different thing from a queue you opened on purpose.

          <strong>This is Today&rsquo;s bands at full length — the same design, mounted as its own page.</strong>{' '}
          A task queue is not a fifth place to look; it is the middle of Today, which is where you will
          actually see it. Ranked by <strong>users affected × frequency</strong> and decayed by recency —
          every field of every evidence bundle is computed from your own events, and no model wrote any of
          it.

        {/* ⚠️ `bands.unknown` is passed too, and the client renders it under its own heading rather
            than dropping it. The database CHECK allows exactly four statuses, so it is empty today —
            but a fifth added by a migration would otherwise vanish from a queue whose entire promise
            is that a human sees what an agent sees. */}
