// Setup › CLI — where `frijoles login` gets its token.
//
// ── Why this is not a section of Setup › Keys ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Keys' lede is "Everything that gives something else access to **this project**", and its
// completeness claim is the whole point of that page. A CLI token gives access to an ACCOUNT — every
// project its holder is a member of — so listing it there would make that sentence false on the one
// page whose entire job is an accurate access inventory. That page instead NAMES this one, in
// `CREDENTIAL_KINDS_NOT_LISTED`, which is how it already handles connector URLs and share links.
//
// ── The gate: MEMBER, and the credential is the SESSION'S, not the project's ──────────────────
// `requireProjectMembership` is here because this page renders inside `ProductShell`, which needs a
// project for its nav — the same reason every other Setup page takes a `projectSlug`. It is NOT the
// authorization for minting: the actions resolve the account from the session and never take a user
// id, so a member of any project can mint a token for themselves and for nobody else.
//
// Not owner-gated, deliberately, and this is the one place in Setup where that is right. Minting an
// ingest key is an act against a tenant; minting a CLI token is an act against your own session. An
// owner-only CLI would mean an ordinary member — who can already read every one of these screens in
// a browser — is barred from reading the same things in a terminal, which is a distinction the
// product cannot defend.

            {/* ⚠️ **`--api` is part of the printed command, and leaving it out was a real defect**
                (fresh reviewer, PR #149). The CLI's own default is `https://goldenfrijoles.com`, so
                on a preview deployment the bare command sent a preview-minted token to PRODUCTION
                and got "not accepted" — a mismatch whose cause is invisible from the terminal.
                Printing the URL beside a command that ignores it is not the same as printing a
                command that uses it.

                The URL comes from `getSiteUrl()`, never from the request's Host header (AGENTS
                rule #5), and on a preview that correctly resolves to the preview's own hostname —
                which is exactly the deployment these tokens address. */}
