// OWNER-only, re-checked server-side on every entry point, with the mutation scoped to the resolved
// `project_id` so a foreign slug or row id matches nothing.

// Server Actions are a public HTTP surface and TypeScript types are erased at runtime, so every
// argument is validated as a real string before use.

/**
 * Which gate is closed, or `null` when minting may proceed.
 *
 * ── Two gates, named separately, because they fail for different reasons ──────────────────────
 * This was one `gatesOpen(): boolean`. Cross-review (vibe) was right that bundling them muddies
 * the intent: a caller could not tell WHICH gate refused, so the error said "the connector is not
 * enabled" even when the connector was fine and the console was dark. Two different operator
 * actions, one message.
 *
 * `CONNECTOR_ENABLED` is AGENTS rule #3: the connector has two independent kill switches, and
 * minting creates the second one. If minting did not also require the first, flipping the connector
 * off would stop it serving while still letting an owner mint credentials for it — a switch you can
 * route around is not a switch.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The `CONSOLE_SHELL_ENABLED` half is GONE — Story 3.3 deleted the flag.** It was checked
 * because this action served a page that 404'd while the console was dark, and a server action is
 * reachable by POST whether or not its page ever rendered. Nothing is dark now; the page always
 * exists, so the branch could never be taken.

// in this file can only ever be source-scanned. AGENTS rule #3 is too load-bearing for that: it
// rested on one unasserted line until cross-review pointed it out (PR #123).
//
// What remains here is only the wiring, and `setup-route-guards.test.ts` pins that BOTH values reach
