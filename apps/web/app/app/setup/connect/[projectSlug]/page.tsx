// Setup › Connect — your own project's connector URL, inside the product.
//
// ── The defect this fixed ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The signed-in shell's `Connect` link pointed at `/install`, a public marketing page that serves
// the DEMO project's connector token (correctly — AGENTS rule #2 requires public routes to serve
// only the demo project). So an operator who followed it got a working URL for somebody else's
// data. `/install` is untouched; what changed is where the product's own link goes.
//
// ── design-system-rails · Sprint 4, Story 4.4 — the page teaches, then hands over the control ──
// Reference state `setup-connect`: the connector URL in a mono field WITH Copy, a status pill, and a
// numbered three-step card ending in `Add to Claude ↗`. The credential half already shipped and
// shipped well — the status, the multi-token warning, and the server-side filtering below — and
// **all of it is kept** (sprint contract #9). What this story adds is the half that makes setup a
// task rather than a credential screen.
//
// ── The console gate is GONE — mockups-as-built Story 3.3 ─────────────────────────────────────
// This page opened with `if (!isConsoleShellEnabled()) notFound()`, so that while the console was
// dark it 404'd for everyone before auth rather than leaking its existence through a login
// redirect. `CONSOLE_SHELL_ENABLED` is deleted from the repository and from every Vercel
// environment; the console is the console. Nothing about AUTHORIZATION changed — the flag never was
// one, and `requireProjectMembership` below is untouched.
