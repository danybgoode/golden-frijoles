// The credential half shipped and shipped well: the status, the multi-token warning, and the
// server-side filtering of `tokens` before they cross the client boundary. **All of it is kept**
// (sprint contract #9) — a member must not be able to read a bearer URL out of View Source, and that
// is a property of where the filter happens, not of what this component renders.
//
// What was missing is the other half of reference state `setup-connect`: the URL in a mono field
// with a Copy button, and a NUMBERED three-step card ending in `Add to Claude ↗`. The page was a
// credential screen with the steps written as a sentence underneath; the design makes setup a task.
