// The specimen — the one screen where the whole language is visible at once.
//
// ── Why this is a real route and not a Storybook ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// Story 2.1: *"a specimen route renders every scale step from `design-system/`… the specimen is how
// a reviewer sees the whole language on one screen."* A separate tool would render the primitives in
// a different document, with different resets and a different font pipeline — which is precisely how
// a component library comes to look one way in its catalogue and another in the product. This
// renders inside the real app, under the real shell, with the real `next/font` families.
//
// It is also the screen Sprint 2's walkthrough hands to Daniel: **the language is approved or
// rejected here, before any page is rebuilt on it.**
//
// ── It is deliberately NOT in the coverage denominator ────────────────────────────────────────
// `OUT_OF_SCOPE_PAGES` in `route-manifest.ts` carries it, with the reason: the specimen IS the
// reference every other route is measured against, so counting it as covered by itself is circular.
// It is still gated — the visual gate asserts it against `MEASURED-SPEC.md`.
//
// ── Access ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// ⚠️ **This was WRONG on its first write, and a cross-family review caught it (agy, Blocking).**
// The check was `if (projectSlug) await requireProjectMembership(projectSlug)` — so
// `/app/design-system` with no `?project=` ran NO auth check at all, while the comment above it
// claimed the route was protected "exactly like every other `/app` route". A comment asserting a
// property the code does not have, on an auth boundary.
//
// And nothing else was covering it: `middleware.ts` is scoped to `/app/:path*` but its own header
// says it is **session PLUMBING ONLY — it does NOT gate routes**, because per-route authorization
// belongs at the data boundary. So the guard genuinely was the whole guard, and it was optional.
//
// What is at stake is smaller than the shape of the bug — the specimen renders no tenant data, every
// value below is a literal chosen to exercise a state — but "it leaks nothing" is not why a route is
// closed. Every sibling under `/app` requires a session, and an internal design surface is not a
// reason to be the one that does not.
//
// So: a session is required unconditionally, and membership additionally when a project is named.

              Everything above is a CONTROL. Everything below is how a whole page is assembled, and
              it is on the specimen for the same reason the controls are: `every primitive the module
              exports actually reaches the specimen` fails on an export with no entry here, and ten
              of the fourteen original primitives went unasserted before that check existed.

              The examples are the real ones. `PageHead` renders the flags page's own head, the list
              card renders a feature row — so the specimen is where a reviewer sees the language
              rather than a diagram of it. */}
