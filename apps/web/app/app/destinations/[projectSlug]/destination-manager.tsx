// The list renders from the `destinations` prop (refreshed by router.refresh() after each mutation,
// since the actions revalidate the path). Only a just-minted signing secret lives in local state —
// it is shown ONCE and never re-fetchable, the same contract as the API-key manager.

// app-component-kit-adoption · Sprint 2, Story 2.2 — converted to DataTable + FormSection/Field.
// The private `formatUtc` copy that lived here is gone in favour of `lib/format-utc.ts` (D11).
//
// app-component-kit-adoption · Sprint 3 — the two-click "Click again to confirm" on Remove is GONE,
// converged onto `ConfirmDialog` (the corrected D5). It was the product's only pre-existing UI
// confirmation and the grooming docs misattributed it to the agent rail, which has no controls at
// all. Two confirmation patterns for one job is what D5 was written to avoid; it just named the
// wrong file. `window.confirm` stays banned for the reason recorded when the two-click was added:
// it blocks the page and the automation harness, so the cancel path could never be spec'd.
//
// Rotate is confirmed too. It reads as routine next to Remove and is not: the previous signing
// secret stops verifying the moment it completes, so every receiver still using it starts rejecting
// deliveries until someone redeploys with the new one.
