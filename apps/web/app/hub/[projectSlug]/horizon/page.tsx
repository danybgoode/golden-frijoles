// pod-report · Sprint 1, Story 1.3 — the horizon view: progress read against the DESTINATION.
//
// The failure mode this page exists to avoid is rendering a backlog. A list of epics sorted by
// status answers "what have we done"; a stakeholder is asking "how much of where we're going is
// lit". So destinations lead, and epics appear only underneath as the things that light them —
// never the other way round.
//
// Every status comes verbatim from `deriveHorizon`, which takes each epic's already-derived
// `shipped` boolean from `summarizeRoadmap`. This page re-derives nothing, so "nothing claims ✅ for
// unshipped work" holds by construction rather than by this file remembering to check.

// ⚠️ **THREE STRENGTHS OF ONE COLOUR, NOT THREE COLOURS** (DD4). Lit / partly lit / on the way is a
// SEQUENCE — how far along — and a sequence is magnitude, so it is `--gold` from filled to dashed.

// alone: every card states its status as a WORD, which is also what `hub.spec.ts` reads.
