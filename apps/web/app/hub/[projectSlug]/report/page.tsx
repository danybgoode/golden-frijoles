// pod-report · Sprint 2.5c — the Pod Report surface, the third hub view beside the journey and the
// horizon. Sprint 2 computed every number and nothing rendered any of it; this is the half that
// makes it a sales artifact instead of a row in `report_artifacts`.
//
// Same gate as its siblings (`requireDashboardAccess` → the demo project reads anonymously via the
// AGENTS rule #2 allow-list, every other slug needs a signed-in member), same freshness stamp.
//
// design-system-rails · Sprint 6, Story 6.3 — reference state `hub-report`. The page is the hub's
// third tab now rather than a link back to the first, and every rendering decision still lives in
// `PodReportBody`, including the `isHonest()` refusal. Read that file's header for what moved onto
// the design system and what is deliberately still on `hub.module.css`.
//
// ── Why the lens is hardcoded to 'team' and not read from anything ────────────────────────────

// route's credential IS a dashboard session, and a dashboard session means the team. Sprint 3's
// share routes resolve `client`/`investor` from a share token and call the same getPodReport();
// accepting a `?lens=` here would hand any reader the widest view by typing it.
