// event-destination-router · Sprint 2, Story 2.2 — the production dispatch trigger.
//
// This is the cron target (see vercel.json's `crons`). Story 1.2's dispatcher was a seam nothing
// invoked in production; this is what finally invokes it — enumerating the projects with due work and
// dispatching once PER PROJECT, because the dispatcher is unconditionally single-tenant (AGENTS.md
// rule #1). One tenant's flaky receiver cannot stall another's queue.
//
// TWO GATES, in order:
//   1. AUTH — this endpoint moves outbound traffic, so it must not be publicly triggerable. Vercel
//      Cron sends `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET`; we require it and compare constant-time. With
//      CRON_SECRET unset we FAIL CLOSED (401) rather than open — an unauthenticated dispatcher is a
//      worse failure than a cron that 401s until the secret is set.
//   2. DELIVERY FLAG — even authenticated, a pass no-ops while DESTINATION_DELIVERY_ENABLED is OFF.
//      The dispatcher itself also checks this (defence in depth), but short-circuiting here means a
//      dark deployment does not even enumerate due work.

// PIN the function's wall-clock limit rather than assuming the platform default (cross-review, Codex
// round 24): TICK_BUDGET_MS below is sized against this number, and if the deployment's limit were
// lower, Vercel would kill the worker mid-batch and leave claims to stale recovery. Declaring it here
// makes the budget's assumption explicit and enforced.
export const maxDuration = 300

const MAX_PROJECTS_PER_TICK = 200

// A wall-clock budget for the whole tick. The per-delivery timeout is 10s and one project can hold
// up to MAX_CLAIM_BATCH rows, so a naive "process every project sequentially" tick could run for
// minutes and blow the function deadline — stranding every project after the slow one (cross-review,
// Codex 2026-07-21). We stop enumerating once we are within one project-batch of the deadline; the
// unprocessed projects still have due work and are simply picked up by the next */5 tick.
// Vercel's default function timeout is 300s, so a 60s tick was leaving most of the window unused
// while forcing tiny per-project slices (cross-review, Codex round 17: an 18s reservation inside a
// 30s slice meant a slow project managed roughly ONE send per tick and released the other 49).
// 240s leaves a 60s margin under the platform limit.
const TICK_BUDGET_MS = 240_000

// A per-PROJECT slice of the tick, so ONE slow tenant cannot monopolize the whole budget and starve
// the others (cross-review, Codex round 5; anti-starvation ORDER is random() in the enumeration RPC).
// Each project is dispatched under a deadline of min(tick deadline, now + this), then defers its
// remainder and yields.
//
// SIZED AGAINST THE TICK, not in isolation (cross-review, Antigravity round 6 then Codex round 10).
// Two failure modes bracket this number:
//   • too small → after the dispatcher's PER_SEND_BUDGET_MS reservation (~18s) a project gets almost
//     no ACTIVE dispatch time (the 15s version left ~-3s, i.e. nothing);
//   • too large → project #1 eats the tick and project #2 is claimed with less than one send budget
//     left, so its rows are claimed and immediately released without ever being sent — churn.
// 60s of a 240s tick leaves ~42s of ACTIVE dispatch per project after the ~18s per-send reservation
// (enough for many normal sends, or ~3 worst-case timeouts), and still lets a tick serve several
// projects. The loop below also refuses to START a project without a full send budget remaining.
