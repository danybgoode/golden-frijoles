// signals-loop · Sprint 3, Story 3.3b — GET /api/v1/reports/pod/lifecycle
//
// The one read `scripts/pod-report.mjs` needs to turn landing §5's adoption-step claim from an
// ASSERTION into a computed figure (Amendment 4.3). The script analyses a git repository and has no
// database access; these facts live in the engine. So it asks, with the credential it already holds
// for pushing the artifact.
//
// ── Why an endpoint rather than enriching the artifact at push time ────────────────────────────
// The push route could add these counts server-side, and it would need no new surface. But the
// maturity lens is computed in the SCRIPT (scripts/lib/maturity-lens.mjs) and arrives at the push
// route already scored — so enriching at push would mean re-scoring server-side, i.e. a second copy
// of the lens. Two implementations of the same scoring rule is one too many, and the second copy is
// the one that drifts. The script fetches, then scores once.
//
// ── Tenancy ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The project comes from the hashed API key, resolved server-side by lib/auth.ts. There is no
// project parameter on this route and no way to ask about another tenant — the same property every
// authed read here has. A tenant reads its own adoption evidence; that is the whole surface.

  // "not measured" — which is NOT the same as zero, and the distinction is the entire point of the
  // criterion this feeds: the lens renders `not_instrumented` for an absent reading and `not_met`
  // for a real zero. Returning zeroes here would quietly convert "we have not switched this on yet"
  // into "no agent is doing any work", which is a claim we would be making about ourselves without
  // having measured it.
