// golden-frijoles-cli · Sprint 1, Story 1.3 — `gf projects ls` and `gf projects create`.
//
// ── D9, and why `create` is an ENSURE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `projects_one_per_creator_idx` (20260721100000_self_serve_tenants.sql) is a partial UNIQUE index
// on `projects(created_by)`: a self-serve account owns exactly ONE project, enforced by the
// database. It is a signup-race guard — two confirmed callbacks from a double-clicked confirmation
// link would otherwise both observe "no membership" and both create a project — not a plan limit,
// and dropping it would reopen the race a cross-review closed.
//
// So there is no second project for this route to create. What it does instead is call the SAME
// idempotent `provisionTenantForUser` the auth callback calls, and report `created: false` with the
// existing slug when there is one.
//
// ⚠️ **An earlier version of this comment claimed it recovers the `?provision=failed` state. That
// was FALSE, and it is the exact defect CODE-QUALITY #3 exists to catch** (cross-family review,
// Codex, PR #149, graded Blocking). Reaching this route needs a CLI token; minting a CLI token needs
// `/app/setup/cli/<slug>`, which needs a membership — so an account with NO project can never call
// it. The prose asserted a capability the code does not have.
//
// **There is no deadlock, and that is why this is a comment fix rather than a new route.** The
// token is minted in a BROWSER either way, and `/app` redirects any project-less signed-in user
// straight to `/app/provision`, which retries provisioning and hands back the same first-run
// experience. A project-less user arriving to mint a token is provisioned before they get there;
// if provisioning genuinely fails they land on `/app?provision=failed` with no tenant, and a CLI
// that could talk to that account would have nothing to talk about.
//
// What this verb IS for: a script saying "make sure I have a project before I init", idempotently,
// without parsing `gf projects ls`. Recovery from a failed provision is a browser task at `/app`.
//
// `gf projects use` is a CLIENT-side concept: it records the active project in the credentials
// file. There is nothing to store server-side, which is why there is no route for it.
