// multi-tenant-activation · Sprint 1, Story 1.1 — SIGN-IN ONLY. Account creation lives on
// `/signup`, behind `SIGNUP_ENABLED`, and the door links there only when that gate is open.
// On success we push to /app and refresh so the server shell re-reads the freshly-set session.
//
// design-system-rails · Sprint 6, Story 6.2 — the approved `door-login` form. It is the design
// system's `Field` and `Button`, not `.auth-form`: the label/error/`aria-describedby` wiring lives
// in the primitive, so this file cannot forget it.

/**
 * What the door says when the credentials do not match.
 *
 * ⚠️ **It is OUR sentence, not Supabase's, and that is a deliberate narrowing.** GoTrue answers
 * `Invalid login credentials` for a wrong password AND for an address that has never been
 * registered — which is correct and non-enumerating — but it answers other messages that are not,
 * `Email not confirmed` being the plain one: it confirms the account exists. Passing every message
 * through verbatim means the page's non-enumeration property depends on which strings a dependency
 * happens to return this release.
 *
 * So the credential-shaped failures collapse into one sentence on the password field, and anything
 * else is shown as what it is — an operational failure, which tells a stranger nothing about an
 * account either way.
 */

 * Which GoTrue failures are "these credentials did not work".
 *
 * Matched on the STATUS plus a small set of codes rather than on the message text, because the text
 * is localisable and the codes are not. `400`/`422` with no recognised code still lands here: a
 * rejected sign-in is a rejected sign-in, and the safe default on this page is the sentence that
 * reveals nothing.
