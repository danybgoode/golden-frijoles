// multi-tenant-activation · Sprint 3, Story 3.1/3.2 — the self-serve front door the flipped hero
// CTA and §7 "Start free" tile both link to. Same dark-until-flipped contract as the API route it
// posts to (app/api/v1/public/signup/route.ts): while SIGNUP_ENABLED is off this page 404s rather
// than rendering a form with nowhere to submit — a live-looking dead end is worse than no route at
// all (mirrors the connector route's own 404-while-dark idiom, lib/flags.ts). `force-dynamic` for
// the same reason as app/page.tsx: the flag is read fresh per request (no module-level capture).
//
// ── design-system-rails · Sprint 6, Story 6.2 — and the ONE approved state that cannot render ──
//
// This page renders `door-signup-open`. The batch also contains **`door-signup-closed`** — the same
// door carrying a waitlist form — and it is **unreachable in this product**, deliberately:
// `notFound()` above means the closed state of `/signup` is a 404, not a waitlist.
//
// That is left alone on purpose. The epic's platform-first note says *every route keeps the gate it
// has today*, and turning a 404 into a 200 is a behaviour change dressed as a port — on the one
// route whose gate decides whether strangers can create tenants. The waitlist itself is not lost:
// it is live on the landing page, which is where `door-signup-closed`'s content already ships.
//
// Recorded rather than quietly skipped, because an approved state with no route is exactly the kind
// of gap this epic exists to make visible. `route-manifest.ts` names `door-signup-open` as this
// route's reference state and says why the other one is not it.
