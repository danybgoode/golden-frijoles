// pod-report · Sprint 3, Story 3.1 — the share surface. One opaque token in the path, no account.
//
// ── Everything meaningful about this route is what it refuses to accept ───────────────────────
// The URL carries ONE segment and it is a bearer token. There is no project slug and no `?lens=`:
// both the tenant and the audience come from the stored row (lib/report-shares.ts), so "show me
// someone else's report" and "show me the wider lens" are not requests that can be expressed —
// which is a stronger property than validating them and saying no (AGENTS: no request-derived read
// path may cross projects).
//
// ── design-system-rails · Sprint 6, Story 6.2 — reference state `public-share` ────────────────
// The page renders inside DD3's PUBLIC frame, and the designed 404 every dead link lands on lives
// beside it in `not-found.tsx` — see that file for why there is exactly one of them.
//
// ── Two independent kill switches, same shape as the MCP connector (AGENTS rule #3) ───────────
// REPORT_SHARES_ENABLED must be on AND the row must be live. The flag is checked FIRST and without
// looking at the token at all, so while dark this route cannot be used as an oracle for whether a
// given token exists.
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'

// person it was sent to; a search engine following it out of a leaked referrer is a data leak with a
// URL attached.

  // ── Why every rejection below is 404 and not 401 ─────────────────────────────────────────────

  // the MCP connector, an API route where 401 is the natural answer. On an HTML page it is the wrong
  // answer, and STRICTLY WEAKER: a 401 confirms "this token was real once", so revoking a leaked
  // link would still tell whoever holds it that they had something valid — an oracle, handed to the
  // exact person you just cut off.
  //
  // 404 for unknown, malformed, expired and revoked alike matches this repo's own established
  // doctrine: lib/dashboard-auth.ts returns 404 and never 403 for a foreign project, deliberately,
  // "so we don't confirm a foreign project's existence". Recorded as a dated amendment in
  // sprint-3.md — this is a comment explaining a decision, not a comment making one.

  // natural key. A rename plus a slug reassignment between the two queries would have pointed a

  // never see it. The approved `setup-shares` state draws an "opens" column on THEIR page, so the

  // different readers, not because one is a fallback for the other.
  // ⚠️ Wrapped, because `after()` swallows nothing and this must never reach the reader.
