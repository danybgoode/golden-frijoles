// Separate from page.tsx for the reason report-components.tsx is separate from its page: page.tsx
// imports `server-only` modules (the token resolver, the query libs), so a spec can never load it.
// These components import nothing but types and the design system, which is what lets
// e2e/report-share.spec.ts assert on real markup instead of only on HTTP status codes.
//
// design-system-rails · Sprint 6, Story 6.2 — reference state `public-share`. The frame is DD3's
// PUBLIC one: a slim bar, the mark, and at most one action. `hub.module.css` is gone from this file
// entirely — a share link had been borrowing the signed-in hub's private stylesheet, which is how a
// page read by somebody with no account ends up looking like a page for somebody with one.

/**
 * The frame around a shared report.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The mark is NOT a link, and the bar offers no way into the product.** The approved state's
 * own callout says why: a share link that quietly offers a way in is a share link that leaks a map
 * of the account. `Frame` renders the brand as plain text when it is given no `brandHref`, which is
 * what makes "no navigation into the product" a property of the markup rather than a promise.
 *
 * Carries the audience note as VISIBLE text, not as a comment or a data attribute. Someone who
 * receives an investor link and wonders why they cannot see the per-criterion rows should be able to
 * read the answer on the page rather than conclude the report is broken.
