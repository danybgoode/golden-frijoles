// design-system-rails · Sprint 6, Story 6.2 — the approved `public-gone` state.
//
// ── ONE page for unknown, malformed, expired AND revoked (finding F2) ──────────────────────────
//
// `page.tsx` calls `notFound()` for all four, deliberately, so the page cannot tell an attacker
// which one a token is. That is the whole design: **there is no expired state, and adding one to
// satisfy a doc would be implementing a security regression.** `sprint-6.md` asked for "the expired
// state" as a designed page until reading the route corrected it.
//
// So the copy below says the three possibilities and refuses to say which — and it says WHY it
// refuses, because a reader who is not an attacker deserves to know the page is being careful
// rather than vague.
//
// ── Why this remains scoped to `/s/[token]` ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The later root not-found page covers other browser paths. Shared links still render this exact
// indistinguishable message. Route-level gates continue to make their own 404 decisions; the
// root page only changes the presentation of a browser response.
