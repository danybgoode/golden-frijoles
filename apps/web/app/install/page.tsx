// build-time-frozen.

// ⚠️ THIS PAGE SERVES THE DEMO PROJECT'S CONNECTOR TOKEN, AND THAT IS CORRECT — do not "fix" it.
//
// AGENTS rule #2: a public read path may only ever serve the demo project. `/install` is public
// marketing, so `DEMO_PROJECT_SLUG` is the only tenant it may resolve. Pointing it at the viewer's
// own project would mean either serving a credential to an anonymous visitor or making a public
// page require a session — the first is a tenancy bug, the second is not a marketing page.
//
// console-ia-overhaul · Sprint 2, Story 2.2: the real defect was that the SIGNED-IN shell linked
// here, so an operator followed "Connect" and got a working URL for somebody else's data. It is
// fixed by the console REPLACING that header, not by rewriting this page's link.
//
// ── design-system-rails · Sprint 6, Story 6.2 — the approved `public-install` state ────────────
//
// The page moves off the landing's `Nav`/`Footer` and onto DD3's PUBLIC frame: a slim bar, the
// mark, and one action. The reason is the design's own rule — *chrome appears when there is
// something to navigate* — and the reason it matters HERE is that the landing nav offers a reader
// six destinations on the page whose entire job is three steps.
//
// ⚠️ **ONE CARD, not three — mockups-as-built Story 4.5.** The approved state is
// `title → note → demobar → list`: a single `.listcard` holding "Demo connector URL", and inside it,
// under its own label, "Three steps" (`console-prototype.html:3621-3636`). The built page rendered
// three separate `Card`s, so the gate read `card → card → card` where the design draws one block.
//
// ⚠️ **The SDK block is KEPT, and it is not in the approved state.** `landing-readability-pass`
// retired the landing's §connect and §sdk sections INTO this page; deleting it to match a mock
// would silently undo a shipped epic's decision, and the prototype has no reason to draw it — it has
// no SDK. It becomes a THIRD labelled section inside the one card rather than a card of its own,
// which is how both hold at once: the approved block sequence exactly, and nothing lost.
//
// ── golden-frijoles-plugin · Sprint 3, Story 3.3 — the install prompt is a FOURTH section ───────
// Same technique, same reason: `installPrompt(getSiteUrl())` (`lib/install-prompt.ts`) is a `CopyPromptCard`
// placed FIRST inside the one `.listcard` — before "Demo connector URL" — because it is the single
// action most visitors of this page actually want (plan and build with an agent), and it needs no
// signed-in project, no seeded demo data and no CLI token to be useful immediately. It is a labelled
// section of the SAME card, never a card of its own, for the identical reason the SDK block is:
// adding a card would change the approved `public-install` block sequence
// (`title → note → demobar → list`), which `apps/web/design-system/state-contract.mjs --check` and
// its console-visual spec both assert. Measured before and after this change — see the sprint
// report — and the built page's signature is unchanged.
export default async function InstallPage() {
  // A cross-review catch: if this ever runs in real Vercel production without SITE_URL set, show
  // the honest "not ready" state instead of a live-looking but broken localhost URL.
