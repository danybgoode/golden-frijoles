// The coverage manifest — one generated number for how much of the product is on the design system.
//
// ── Why this exists ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The previous epic's visual gate was born covering ONE route of twenty-nine, with five deferred
// rows and no way to see that from the outside. An XXL redesign with no finish line is a redesign
// that stops when someone gets tired, and an off-system page is a debt nobody can point at. This
// module is the finish line: every in-scope route, what it must look like, and whether it does.
//
// ── "No second list" — what that actually means here (epic README, D5-b) ──────────────────────
// The scaffolded plan said the manifest "extends `lib/project-route-inventory.ts`". It cannot,
// literally: that list holds **14** surfaces and this epic covers **29** routes. The two answer
// different questions — the inventory answers *"what may this member navigate to"* (so `/login` is
// correctly absent from it), and this answers *"is this route on the design system"* (so `/login`
// is correctly present here). Folding one into the other would put the sign-in page in a member's
// navigation.
//
// So the inventory stays the single source of truth for the 14 nav surfaces, this is the single
// source of truth for design coverage, and `route-manifest.test.ts` WELDS them: every inventory
// surface must have a row here, so a new nav surface with no reference state turns the manifest red
// rather than silently reducing the percentage.
//
// ── The rows are checked against the filesystem, not trusted ──────────────────────────────────
// `route-manifest.test.ts` walks `apps/web/app` for real `page.tsx` files and asserts the manifest
// and the repository agree about which routes exist. A hand-maintained list of routes is a list
// that goes stale the first time someone adds a page; this one cannot.
//
// ── Zero imports, deliberately ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// This module imports NOTHING, including `lib/project-route-inventory.ts`. Two reasons, and the
// second is the load-bearing one:
//
//   1. `@/` is a TypeScript path alias that Node does not resolve, and the unit layer runs these
//      files under bare `node --test`. A runtime import would have to be relative AND carry a `.ts`
//      extension, which the app's own tsconfig rejects (TS5097).
//   2. The weld belongs in the TEST, not in the data. `route-manifest.test.ts` imports both lists
//      and asserts they agree. A data module that pulls in a second list to check itself is a
//      module that can only be read by loading half the app — and this one is read by a Playwright
//      spec, a CI script and a unit test.
