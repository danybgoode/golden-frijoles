/** @jsxImportSource react */
// ⚠️ **The pragma is a NO-OP under Next and LOAD-BEARING for the test rail** — design-system-rails
// Sprint 6, Story 6.3. Playwright's transform pins its OWN jsx runtime, which emits `__pw_type`
// objects that `react-dom/server` refuses to render, so any `.spec.tsx` that renders a component
// from this file dies with "Objects are not valid as a React child".
//
// It became necessary the moment `app/hub/report-components.tsx` started composing `Answer`,
// `Callout`, `Empty` and `PageHead` from here: that file has carried the same line since Sprint 2.5c
// (as do `hub-components.tsx` and `s/[token]/share-components.tsx`), but a pragma is PER FILE — a
// caller having it does nothing for the JSX inside the component it calls. Fourteen specs went red
// at once, all with the same unrelated-looking error, which is exactly the failure mode the three
// existing comments describe.
//
// The rule, stated once: a `design-system/` module that any `.spec.tsx` renders needs this line.
// The primitives, as components — so a page is assembled rather than hand-drawn in CSS.
//
// ── Why these exist when `components/ui/` already has primitives ──────────────────────────────
// They do not replace it. Audit §2.2 is explicit — *"the primitives already exist and are
// reasonably built. The work is mostly adoption and a handful of new primitives"* — and Story 2.3
// says existing ones are adopted and extended, never re-authored. What is here is the handful the
// approved design needs and `components/ui/` has no equivalent for: the three-state switch, the
// rail item as a raised card, the environment control, the numbered step card, the wizard.
//
// The rest are thin: a component exists for each so that a page never types `ds-btn` by hand, which
// is what keeps the namespace enforceable and the states reachable. A class typed into a route is a
// class no primitive owns.
//
// ── The states are DATA, not variants of a name ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// Every stateful primitive takes `state` from one closed union, and the CSS keys off
// `[data-state]`. That is deliberate: a `loading` prop and an `isError` prop and a `disabled`
// attribute are three ways to say one thing, and they can disagree. One field cannot.

// for the list: the header row and every body row share three fixed column widths, and a page that
