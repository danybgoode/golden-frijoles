// ── Why this exists, and what it replaced ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The epic scaffolded a per-route SCREENSHOT DIFF against the reference PNGs (D2 as refined), with
// a threshold to be settled by making `/app/journeys` red and `/app/flags` green. It was measured
// before it was written, and the two routes come out in the WRONG ORDER:
//
//   ship-features   (built to its state)      6.9% raw pixel difference   band count off by 2
//   measure-journeys (NOT built to its state) 6.4% raw pixel difference   band count off by 0
//
// The page we know is correct is farther from its picture than the page we know is wrong, and the
// structural metric calls the wrong page a perfect match. That is not a threshold problem. The
// reference PNG is a picture of a DIFFERENT ARTIFACT: the prototype's content column is x=236
// w=1180 and the product's is x=278 w=1120, so every glyph on every route is displaced by
// construction; the PNG paints a `PROTOTYPE` badge, a `D` avatar and a `.callout.info` designer
// annotation that must never be product UI; and it is a 960px clip of designs up to 1711px tall,
// so `today.png` shows 56% of its own state. Full numbers and the four causes: the epic README, D2.
//
// So the comparison moves from PIXELS to STRUCTURE, and the source moves from the picture to the
// artifact the picture is rendered from — `console-prototype.html`, which is the file `APPROVED.md`
// hashes. Nothing moves further from the approval; it moves closer to it. The PNGs keep the job a
// picture is actually good for: they are uploaded with every CI run and put in front of a person.
//
// ── What a signature is ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// For one approved state: the ordered sequence of content blocks inside the content column, by
// KIND, with only the facts that survive a change of dataset — the tile count, the list's column
// words, the primary action's label, the number of small plots. Never a value, never a row count,
// never a pixel. Production holds ONE journey where `measure-journeys` draws three (epic D13-c), so
// a signature that could see data would be a signature that goes red on a correct page.
//
// The same function extracts it from the prototype and from a built route — one implementation, two
// consumers (CODE-QUALITY #2). That is the whole reason `extractSignature` takes its vocabulary as
// an argument instead of closing over it: it is serialised into two different browsers.
