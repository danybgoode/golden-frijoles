 * Where uppercase is allowed, and why.

 * BOTH halves are violated, and my first count of this was wrong.**
 *
 * It read: *"eight rules apply uppercase inside `.is-console`, and none of them is mono — so half
 * of that Do-not is already satisfied."* That was true of `console.css` and **false of the
 * console**: the scan read two of the four stylesheets that paint it. Widened, `globals.css` adds
 * twelve more console rules and **every one of them is uppercase AND mono** — the pair the contract
 * forbids outright (fresh reviewer, Major, mutation-verified).
 *
 * `.product-shell__signal` is the clearest: `console.css` resets it inside
 * `.is-console .product-shell__identity`, so the LIT console is fine — and the legacy branch, which
 * is what the public/legacy shell branch serves, renders uppercase mono.
 *
 * Rather than delete eighteen rules blind in the sprint that builds the language — Sprint 2 owns
 * none of those surfaces, and a blind sweep is how a redesign breaks a page nobody was looking at —
 * every one is listed with what it is, whether it is mono, and which sprint removes it.
 * `vocabulary.test.ts` fails if the set ever **grows**. **A list that cannot grow is the difference
 * between a Do-not and a decision**: these are recorded debt with an owner, not an oversight
 * nobody costed.
