// design-system-rails · Sprint 6, Story 6.1 — SEAM B.
//
// ── What this is, and what it is deliberately NOT ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// `ProductShell` is seam A: the console's three tiers, wrapped round the twenty-one signed-in
// routes. This is seam B, and it is the chrome for the other nine — `/login`, `/signup`,
// `/install`, `/s/[token]`, `/talk` and the four `/hub` routes. Before it, those nine shared **no**
// wrapper at all: `.auth-shell` painted two of them, the landing's `Nav`/`Footer` painted two more,
// `hub.module.css` painted four, and `/s/[token]` borrowed `../../hub/report-components`. Four
// answers to one question is how a product ends up looking like four products.
//
// ⚠️ **It is shared CHROME, not a gate, and it has nothing to ask** (epic README, **D6**, Daniel,
// 2026-08-31). The scaffolded plan had this component calling `isDesignV2Enabled()`. There is no
// such predicate and there is no flag: the redesign ships straight to production. A frame that
// reads a switch is a frame with two designs behind it, and the whole saving of D6 is that there is
// only one.
//
// ⚠️ **Root `layout.tsx` was considered and REJECTED at the architecture lock.** It also wraps `/`
// and `/methodology`, which `landing-maker-ops` and `methodology-experience` own and ship on the
// brand system. This epic's frame has no business wrapping them, and `OUT_OF_SCOPE_PAGES` in
// `route-manifest.ts` says so by name.
//
// ── The three frames are DD3, not a taste ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// *Chrome appears when there is something to navigate.* Signed out there is no project, no
// environment and no sections, so the console's three tiers would be four rows of controls that do
// nothing:
//
//   door    — one centred column, no nav at all. `/login`, `/signup`.
//   public  — a slim bar: the mark, and the actions a stranger may take. `/install`, `/s/[token]`,
//             `/talk`, and the designed 404 every dead share link lands on.
//
// ⚠️ **There was a fourth, `hub`, and one-header-one-name retired it (D11).** It drew the Hub as the console's PEER —
// the same bar plus its own tabs and a "Back to the console" button — because `design-system-rails` DD2 kept the Hub
// out of the header. Audit decision 3 reversed DD2: the Hub's pages render in `ProductShell` under Plan (the report
// under Measure), so the variant, its tier-2 `nav`, its `scope` and the CSS only it used are gone with it.
//
// Same tokens, same type, same buttons, same honest empty and error states in all three. Only the
// frame changes, and it changes for a reason that fits in one sentence.

/** Which of DD3's frames this page wears. `console` is `ProductShell`'s, and is not reachable here. */

  // (`console.css`'s `.is-console main p` at (0,1,2) out-specifies a bare `.ds-x` at (0,1,0) and
  // strips the primitives' colours). A descendant selector does not match the element that carries
  // the scope class, so **the entire frame block silently did not apply**: `/login` rendered
  // top-left on the browser's default ground instead of one centred column on the roast.
  //
  // Nothing structural could see it. The visual gate counts `ds-` classes inside `<main>`, measures
  // the chrome budget and checks for horizontal scroll — all four assertions passed on a page that
  // looked wrong, which is the exact failure this epic is named after, reproduced by me in its last
  // sprint. It was found by opening the page.
  //
  // So the scope root is its own element everywhere, and `.ds` is never a second class on anything
  // the stylesheet targets. `every ds- element sits inside a .ds ancestor` in the visual gate is the
  // guard that makes this stay true — it goes red on exactly this mistake, anywhere in the product.
