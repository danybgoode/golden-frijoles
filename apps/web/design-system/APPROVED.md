# Approved states — the design contract for `design-system-rails`

> **Binding.** These 33 states are the contract for every route this epic touches. They are not
> "inspiration". WAYS-OF-WORKING was amended on 2026-08-29 to say so:
> *where the product owner has approved a design, the design IS the contract.*

## The approval

| | |
|---|---|
| **Approved by** | Daniel (product owner) |
| **Approved** | 2026-08-29, in four reviewed batches |
| **Source** | `console-prototype.html` in this folder |
| **SHA-256 (first 16)** | `5bc7e24ed5e3d0aa` |
| **States** | **33**, rendered by `render-reference.mjs` — verified running, zero page errors |

### The 33rd, approved 2026-09-09 (`mockups-as-built`, epic D8)

`wizard-new-feature` — `wizardModal()`, `console-prototype.html:1992`. **It was drawn on
2026-08-29 and not approved**, and the omission was load-bearing: all six primary authoring
actions in the other 32 states are `toast()` stubs reading *"the same wizard shape as New
feature"*, so the approved design drew six doors with no room behind any of them. The
disclosures `mockups-as-built` deletes were meanwhile the only implementation of journey
creation, experiment creation, scenario launch/stop and delivery replay.

Daniel's decision, 2026-09-09: *"The New feature wizard at console-prototype.html:1992 is now an
approved state — treat it as the 33rd. Every + New … and ▸ Run a drill opens that shape, as a
modal, wrapping the existing manager component underneath. … Two hard rules: no capability is
lost, and no `<details>` survives. If those two ever conflict again, the answer is a modal, not a
disclosure."*

⚠️ **The prototype's content hash is UNCHANGED.** The wizard was already in the file; what changed
is that it now has an approval line. No edit was made to `console-prototype.html`, which is why
the SHA above still holds — exactly the property this file exists to protect.

**The hash is the point.** Rail 2 says approval is recorded as a file with the state's content hash,
not as a memory of a conversation. If `console-prototype.html` changes and this hash is not
updated with a new approval line, the design is **unapproved** and the gate should say so. Editing
the prototype and quietly leaving the hash alone is the one move this file exists to prevent.

## How it was approved

Nine states were approved 2026-08-27 with `console-ia-overhaul` and re-rendered unchanged on
2026-08-29. The remaining twenty-three were designed and approved in four batches on 2026-08-29,
each published as a clickable prototype and reviewed screen by screen:

| Batch | States | Approved |
|---|---|---|
| — (inherited) | `ship-features` · `ship-features-dormant` · `feature-value` · `feature-environments` · `feature-funnel` · `setup-connect` · `setup-keys` · `ship-activity` · `ship-compare` | 2026-08-27 |
| **1 · Measure** | `measure-north-star` · `measure-journeys` · `measure-journey` · `measure-scenarios` · `funnel-standalone` | 2026-08-29 |
| **2 · Today, Ship, Setup** | `today` · `tasks-standalone` · `ship-experiments` · `experiment-ready` · `experiment-blocked` · `setup-destinations` · `setup-shares` | 2026-08-29 |
| **3 · The hub** | `hub-roadmap` · `hub-epic` · `hub-horizon` · `hub-report` | 2026-08-29 |
| **4 · The doors** | `door-login` · `door-signup-closed` · `door-signup-open` · `public-install` · `public-share` · `public-gone` · `public-talk` | 2026-08-29 |
| **5 · The wizard** | `wizard-new-feature` | **2026-09-09** |
| **6 · Experiments for humans** — in `approved-prototype.html` | `wizard-new-experiment` · `wizard-new-experiment-review` · `experiment-results` · `experiment-results-ready` · `experiment-decided` | **2026-09-24** |

### Batch 6, approved 2026-09-24 07:44 America/Mexico_City (`experiments-for-humans`, epic D12)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Approved by** | Daniel (product owner) |
| **Source** | `approved-prototype.html` in this folder — a SECOND approved artifact |
| **SHA-256 (first 16), approved-prototype.html** | `0f7c5be3c9c316e4` |
| **States** | **5**: `wizard-new-experiment` (steps 1–5), `wizard-new-experiment-review`, `experiment-results` (still gathering), `experiment-results-ready`, `experiment-decided` |
| **Published** | https://claude.ai/artifact/2MHJPipgJRHLT2tndtdmKx |

Its stylesheet is `reference.css` **verbatim** followed by `x-`-prefixed additions on the same
tokens; `extract-css.mjs` asserts the verbatim prefix and lifts the additions into
`reference-experiments.css`. The states run inside their own prototype (`STATE_SOURCES` in
`approved-states.mjs`), so the console prototype and its hash `5bc7e24ed5e3d0aa` are untouched.

**Superseded, not deleted:** `experiment-ready` → `experiment-results-ready`, and
`experiment-blocked` → `experiment-results` (a blocked readout is a gathering state with its blockers
named). Both stay registered until `experiments-for-humans` Sprint 4 rebuilds
`/app/experiments/[projectSlug]/[experimentKey]` on the new states; the route manifest moves then.

**Not product UI**, though drawn in the approved file: the "Build notes" toggle and every `.bn`
annotation, the `Prototype` pill, the "See this page on day …" picker, and the example screens inside
version cards (epic A4 — screenshot upload is deferred). The "Monday 28 Sep, 9:00" start chip is
dropped until a scheduler exists (epic A6).

## Approved surfaces

*Added 2026-09-30 by `sketch-specs` (epic README D12).* A state can be approved as a `surface` block instead of a
prototype drawing: the file lives in `surfaces/<state>.surface` and its approval is a line here with the first 16 hex
of the file's SHA-256. `state-contract.mjs --check` and `surface-contract.test.ts` fail on a surface with no line, a
line whose hash no longer matches the file, and a line for a file that does not exist. Like the prototype lines
above (pinned by `tokens.test.ts`), this hash is checked by code.

The first approved surfaces are the board's (`board-sinks-and-scrumban`, lock D23): drawn in the epic's seed, reviewed
visually and approved by the product owner on 2026-10-01, then corrected only where the live system forced it (real
routes; no `tabs` line — the hub tabs are the frame's nav, outside the measured `<main>`; `steps` carries no count in
this repo; the card is a page state at `?card=`, not an overlay). The product owner approved those corrections and
asked the architect to record the lines on 2026-10-02.

| State | File | SHA-256 (first 16) | Approved by | Approved |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| hub-board | `surfaces/hub-board.surface` | `ab51f60a6cefbbd0` | Daniel (recorded by the architect at his instruction) | 2026-10-02 |
| hub-board-card | `surfaces/hub-board-card.surface` | `06d5e165f22f2be7` | Daniel (recorded by the architect at his instruction) | 2026-10-02 |
| hub-board-empty | `surfaces/hub-board-empty.surface` | `8c2f5f0b8892e590` | Daniel (recorded by the architect at his instruction) | 2026-10-02 |
| hub-roadmap-areas | `surfaces/hub-roadmap-areas.surface` | `4f2a3fc2d45bc950` | Daniel (recorded by the architect at his instruction) | 2026-10-02 |
| hub-workspace-board | `surfaces/hub-workspace-board.surface` | `816bc514e4a22105` | Daniel (recorded by the architect at his instruction) | 2026-10-02 |

## Design decisions settled at approval — the lock does NOT reopen these

Each was put to the product owner and answered. A builder cites them; the architecture lock verifies
the *code* claims around them, not the design call itself.

**DD1 — Tasks lives on Today, as its missing third band.** A task's real states are
`open | claimed | resolved | dismissed` and `claimedBy` names the actor. Today already asked
"waiting on you" and "what changed" — the two ends of that lifecycle with the middle missing. So
Today gains **Your agent is working**, and `/app/tasks` is the same three bands mounted as its own
page. Today gets no rail; giving it one to hold Tasks would break the thing that makes Today *Today*.

**DD2 — The hub is a peer view of the project, not a fifth section.** The console answers "how is
the product doing"; the hub answers "how is the work doing". The switch lives in the **project
switcher menu**, so tier 1 stays *switcher · ⌘K · account, nothing else* and "four destinations"
survives. `⌘K` reaches every hub surface and every epic by slug — required, because the epic's own
outcome test is "every surface in three clicks or one ⌘K".

> ⚠️ **DD2 is REVERSED — 2026-10-06, audit decision 3, enacted by `one-header-one-name` (D1–D4, D11).** The Hub is no
> longer the console's peer: its Roadmap, Board and Horizon are the console's **Plan** section and its report is
> Measure's **Outcome report**, so the header reads Today · Plan · Ship · Measure · Setup and the Hub renders in
> `ProductShell` with no bar of its own and no "Back to the console". Approved by the product owner in the UX audit
> session (2026-10-05). The text above is kept as the history of why it was once a peer.

**DD3 — Chrome appears when there is something to navigate.** Three frames, one language:
**door** (one centred column, no nav — login, signup), **public** (a slim bar, the mark and at most
one action — install, a shared report, the 404, talk), **console** (the three tiers).

**DD4 — The chart colour rules, computed rather than chosen.** Validated against the dark surface:
- **Magnitude → `--gold` alone**, light to dark. Never a rainbow.
- **Two-way identity → `--gold` + `--blue`** (or grey + blue for control/treatment). CVD ΔE 23.4
  protan, 23.2 tritan, normal-vision 25.3. Safe.
- **Status → `--green` / `--red`, always with a word and a shape**, never colour alone. Deutan
  ΔE 9.9 is above the floor but only just, and red/green is the classic CVD pair.
- **Never four categorical hues.** The brand's four accents **fail** as a four-way set. Beyond two
  series: small multiples, or fold into "Other".
- **Never a dual axis.** The North Star and its leading inputs are different scales, so they are
  small multiples, not two lines on one plot.
- **A nonzero value never rounds to zero pixels.** 3 failures of 1,843 draws under a pixel and reads
  as "nothing failed"; failure segments carry a 4px minimum and the exact count sits beside them.

**DD5 — One design, two mounts.** `/app/funnel/…` and `/app/tasks` render the *same* design as
the tab and the band they also live in. A standalone route is a mount, never a fifth place to look.

## Findings raised at design time — for the architecture lock to settle

**F1 — The approved design contains a glyph the CI guard bans.** `check-design-drift.mjs` forbids
`↗` inside `/app`, and the approved Setup › Connect carries **"Add to Claude ↗"**. The design and
a live CI rail are in direct conflict on one button. Every other glyph in this prototype is inline
SVG, which proves D4's `Icon` route works; this one is left exactly as approved rather than quietly
edited. **D4 says do not disable the rule**, so the answer is almost certainly an SVG arrow.

**F2 — There is no expired state for a share link, and that is a decision.**
`app/s/[token]/page.tsx` calls `notFound()` for unknown, malformed, expired **and** revoked
alike, so the page cannot tell an attacker which one a token is. `sprint-6.md` originally asked for
"the expired state" as a designed page; it is corrected to `public-gone`, the one 404 all four
cases land on. The copy deliberately does not say which.

**F3 — One epic has no build-order number.** There are 27 epic directories and the sequence runs to
26. `hub-roadmap` shows 26 positions and says so rather than padding the track to make the
arithmetic work. Worth fixing in the frontmatter; the board is generated from those numbers.

## Decided after approval — `design-system-rails`, 2026-08-29

**DA1 — Ship › Scheduled changes is BUILT, as a designed empty state.** The architecture lock found
that the approved Ship rail has four items and the product has no scheduled-changes route, table or
capability — verified by grep across the whole repo. `sprint-4.md` described the absence as *"the
rail shows 0 today"*, which is the prototype's rail, not the product's.

Dropping a rail item is an amendment to an approved design, so it went to the product owner rather
than into the architect's judgement.

> **Daniel, 2026-08-29: ship the designed empty-state route.** `/app/scheduled/[projectSlug]` is
> built in Story 4.3, the rail keeps its fourth item, and the surface enters
> `lib/project-route-inventory.ts` and the coverage manifest.

The recommendation that was not taken is recorded because it names the risk to mitigate: Story 4.1's
own rule is *"a control that goes nowhere is worse than no control"*. **So the empty state must say
plainly that scheduling is not available yet.** It must not read as *"you have no scheduled
changes"*, which implies you could have some. An empty state is one of the nine and is a
deliverable, not a fallback.

**No prototype bytes changed.** `console-prototype.html` is untouched and its hash still reads
`5bc7e24ed5e3d0aa` — this is a decision about how the product implements an approved state, not a
change to the state.
