/**
 * Playwright harness — see WAYS-OF-WORKING.md's "Automated QA" section for the two-layer shape
 * this implements.
 *
 * Projects:
 *   - `api`       — the deterministic gate. API-level specs (`*.spec.ts`, excluding both browser
 *                   families) hit public endpoints via the `request` fixture against `baseURL`.
 *                   No browser binaries -> fast, cheap, runs in CI on every PR.
 *   - `browser`   — opt-in ANONYMOUS real-browser smoke (`*.browser.spec.ts`, Chromium). Asserts
 *                   *rendered* UI an API call can't see. NOT in the blocking gate.
 *   - `authed`    — opt-in SIGNED-IN real-browser smoke (`*.authed.spec.ts`). Depends on
 *                   `auth-setup`, which provisions a disposable user + tenant and logs in through
 *                   the real form; `auth-teardown` removes them afterwards. Also NOT in the gate.
 *
 *   npx playwright test                      # everything (needs `playwright install`)
 *   npm run test:e2e                         # api only -- the gate
 *   npm run test:e2e:browser                 # anonymous browser smoke
 *   npm run test:e2e:authed                  # signed-in browser smoke (provisions + cleans up)
 *
 * Point at any environment with PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL; defaults to local dev below.
 *
 * If your deploy rail's previews are SSO-gated (e.g. Vercel's protection), set
 * VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET (or your rail's equivalent) and send it as a header/cookie on
 * every request -- never hardcode it; CI injects it from a secret.
 *
 * Grow coverage one spec per new browser/API-testable story (see WAYS-OF-WORKING.md -> Automated QA).
