// event-destination-router · Sprint 2, Story 2.2 — the outbox dispatcher, now SENDING for real.
//
// Story 1.2 shipped this dark: it claimed due work and released it, because there was no signed send
// and no retry engine yet. Story 2.2 replaces the release with the real thing — sign, POST, and
// settle each row to delivered / failed (retry scheduled) / dead (terminal) based on the answer.
//
// WHAT CHANGED FROM SPRINT 1, PRECISELY:
//   • The two-statement select-then-update claim is now ONE atomic `claim_deliveries` RPC with FOR
//     UPDATE SKIP LOCKED (20260724100000_delivery_retry.sql) — the successor the S1 file named. The
//     RPC also reclaims rows stranded in_flight by a dead worker, closing S1's documented residual
//     window before the gate flips.
//   • A claimed row is now SENT, then settled. attempt_count is incremented as part of settling —
//     a real attempt was made, so the backoff/dead-letter maths (lib/retry-policy.ts) is now driven
//     by a true count, not the imaginary one S1 refused to write.
//
// STILL ALWAYS PROJECT-SCOPED (AGENTS.md rule #1): projectId is required; the RPC and every settle
// re-assert it. The production trigger (app/api/internal/dispatch-deliveries) enumerates projects
// with due work and calls this once per project, so one worker's blast radius is one tenant.
//
// STILL (almost) ZERO-IMPORT, and this is load-bearing: the Supabase client AND fetch are INJECTED,
// and this module imports NO `server-only` module (it does its own db reads rather than calling the
// server-only lib/destinations.ts). That is what lets a spec call dispatchPendingDeliveries() with a
// real db + a fake fetch and observe every settle branch — the LEARNINGS.md rule about guards behind
// preconditions. lib/destinations.ts remains the ONLY reader of a signing secret on the app side;
// here the secret is read through the injected service-role db on the internal send path, never
// exposed to any surface.
