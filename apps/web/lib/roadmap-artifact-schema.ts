// pod-report · Sprint 1, Story 1.1 — the roadmap-push contract.
//
// The payload is the output of `node scripts/roadmap-extract.mjs --live` (board-sinks-and-scrumban D15), the epic's
// stated contract ("that JSON is the contract, version field validated on ingest"). The extract
// emits a BARE ARRAY of rows with no envelope and no version of its own, so this module defines the
// envelope the rail actually ships: a schema version, provenance, and the rows.
//
// ── Why a version the SENDER supplies rather than one we infer ────────────────────────────────
// Clients push this with their own API key from their own tooling on their own release cadence
// (the "clients push their extract" shape the epic locks in — the engine never reads anyone's git).
// So the payload's shape will drift out from under us, and an artifact stored today must still be
// interpretable in a year. An explicit, validated `schemaVersion` turns that drift into a clean 400
// at the boundary instead of a renderer crashing on a field that quietly changed meaning.
//
// No FRAMEWORK or server-only imports, on purpose (Roadmap/LEARNINGS.md — a unit-tested pure helper
// cannot share a file with a `server-only` / `next/*` import, because a plain test runner throws an
// opaque, unrelated-looking error the moment it loads the file at all). `zod` is a portable library
// and loads fine under `node --test`, which is why `roadmap-artifact-schema.test.ts` can assert this
// contract directly with no server, no Supabase and no Playwright. The Supabase read lives next
// door in `report-artifacts.ts`, which DOES import `server-only` — that split is the point.
