// landing-maker-ops · Sprint 1, Story 1.3 — the four operating surfaces, as data.
//
// ── Why this is a module and not four blocks of JSX ───────────────────────────────────────────
// The Ops panel shows one surface at a time out of four with identical structure. Written inline
// that is four near-copies of the same markup, and the fourth one drifts — a different heading
// level, a missing badge, a capability list that grew a fifth item nobody styled. One shape, one
// renderer, four rows.
//
// ── Why STATUS is not in the data ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// CODE-QUALITY #2 and #9, and this repo has paid for both. A landing section stating a flag
// position it does not read goes stale the moment someone flips the flag, and the page then makes
// a checkable claim that is false — the worst kind, because it is the kind a reader can verify.
//
// So a surface declares its `availability` — what KIND of thing it is — and the position is
// resolved at render time from the live gates by `resolveSurfaceStatus` below:
//
//   • 'shipped'  — serving, no gate qualifies it.
//   • 'gated'    — built, but part of it sits behind named flags. Says WHICH part, and reads them.
//   • 'unbuilt'  — does not exist. Cannot be made 'live' by editing this file, because there is no
//                  flag to read; the type has no field that would let a string say otherwise.
//
// That last one is the structural half of epic D4. The obvious mistake for a future contributor is
// to flip FinOps to "live" in a hurry when the first cost dashboard ships; they will have to add an
// `availability: 'gated'` with a real gate to do it, which is exactly the moment to notice the
// claim needs a flag behind it.
