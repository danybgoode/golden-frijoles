  // this closes is worth naming: production carries THIRTEEN distinct audit actions and not one of
  // them is connector-related, so until now a credential authorizing reads of a tenant's data could
  // be created and revoked leaving no trace anywhere. Minting was not self-serve before (A10), which
  // is how the gap survived — but the token could still be revoked, silently.

  // signals-loop · Sprint 2, Story 2.2 — the task lifecycle. ONE action with the transition in its
  // metadata, rather than task_claimed/task_resolved/task_dismissed as separate labels: the three
  // share a single code path (transition_task), and three labels over one path is how a record ends
  // up describing the endpoint someone happened to call instead of what actually changed — the
  // pod-report S3 finding, one layer up. Sprint 3's agent writes reuse this same action, so

  // signals-loop · Sprint 3, Story 3.1 — the agent-write credential lifecycle. Their OWN labels,
  // beside `api_key_*` and `report_share_*` rather than folded into them, because these three
  // credential kinds share one table and one revoke shape but answer completely different incident
  // questions: "why did ingest stop?", "who handed our numbers to an outsider?", and "which agent
  // credential moved this task?". A trail that cannot separate them is read as authoritative and
  // answers all three wrong (LEARNINGS: an audit label that can be chosen by picking an endpoint is
  // worse than no audit log). lib/agent-write-keys.ts pins the labels to the scope with a predicate
  // in the UPDATE, so the endpoint cannot decide what the record says.

  // share a shape but answer different incident questions, and this one answers a question none of
  // the others can — "which laptop or CI job was signed in to `frijoles` when this flag changed?"
  //
  // ⚠️ These are the only actions in this union whose rows carry `project_id: null`, and that is
  // correct rather than a gap. A CLI token belongs to an ACCOUNT; filing its mint under whichever
  // project the operator happened to be looking at would make that project's trail claim something
  // about its own access that is not true. Query them by `actor_user_id`.
