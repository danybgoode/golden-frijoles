// golden-frijoles-cli · Sprint 2 — the write executor. The I/O half of D4.
//
// ── The division of labour, and why it is the whole of D4 ─────────────────────────────────────
// `@golden-frijoles/sdk`'s `plan*` functions decide WHAT to write — the definition and the
// environments — with zero I/O. This module does the writing. The CLI and (Sprint 3.4) the MCP
// write tools both arrive here through the same planners, so a verb and its tool cannot disagree
// about what "kill" means: there is one implementation of that decision and it is not in this file.
//
// Grep this module for a variant lookup, a rollout calculation or a polarity branch. There is none.
//
// ── D2: the partial-failure contract, implemented ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// Three environments, three writes, NO TRANSACTION — `set_flag_activation` is one RPC per
// environment and Supabase speaks REST, not sessions. So:
//
//   • each environment is attempted INDEPENDENTLY; one failing does not stop the others,
//   • each gets a row in the report with its own status and its own error,
//   • the caller is told `partial` when some succeeded and some did not,
//   • and there is NO ROLLBACK ATTEMPT. "Undo the two that worked" is a fourth non-transactional
//     write that can itself half-fail, turning one legible partial state into an illegible one.
//
// ── D10: nothing new touches flag state ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Every write below goes through `lib/flag-registry.ts` — the same `create_flag_definition_version`
// and `set_flag_activation` the console's own server actions call, carrying the same
// `expected_snapshot_version`, writing the same audit rows, and re-checking project OWNERSHIP
// inside the SECURITY DEFINER function regardless of what this application code believes.

  // ── reuse an identical version rather than writing a new one ───────────────────────────────
  //
  // ⚠️ **`create_flag_definition_version` ALWAYS creates a version** — it takes `max(version)+1` and
  // inserts. So without this, re-running `frijoles flags create … --all-envs` produced v1, v2, v3… of a
  // definition that never changed, and every re-run rewrote the activation and wrote an audit row
  // saying something had happened. An agent re-running its own setup script is the ordinary case,
  // not an edge one, and the epic's acceptance says re-running is idempotent.
  //
  // Found by auditing that acceptance criterion against the RPC rather than ticking it.
  //
  // The semantics match `import_flag_definition_catalog`, which the catalog-sync path already has:
  // an identical definition is a no-op that reports itself as one.
  //
  // ⚠️ **Compared CANONICALLY, and this comment used to claim that was already true when it was
  // not.** It said "matching on the PARSED shape, so key order cannot make two identical definitions
  // look different" above a raw `JSON.stringify` comparison — and Postgres `jsonb` REORDERS object
  // keys on storage, so a stored definition and a freshly planned one never stringified alike, and
  // the reuse never fired. Found by the end-to-end spec on its first run; every unit test compared
  // two objects that had never been through the database. `canonical` sorts keys recursively.
  //
  // ⚠️ **Only the NEWEST version is eligible for reuse** (cross-family review, Codex, PR #150,
  // Blocking). The first version reused ANY identical historical version — so with v1=off and
  // v2=on, `frijoles flags set --value false` matched v1 and re-activated it: a change recorded in the
  // lifecycle as a rollback to an old version, and, because rollout bucketing is keyed on the
  // definition VERSION, one that can re-bucket users differently from a fresh version with the same
  // rules. "The command already happened" is only true of the newest version; anything older is
