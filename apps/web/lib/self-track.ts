// visitor→waitlist funnel is measured by the engine itself, through the real customer-facing SDK
// (AGENTS.md rule #1 — no parallel telemetry pipeline, no direct events insert from app code).
//
// This helper is the one seam that fires those two funnel events. It is deliberately total: it
// NEVER throws into a request path and NEVER breaks the page/route if it can't send. CI's
// `typecheck-build` job runs `npm run build` with zero Supabase/tracking env vars, and the `e2e`
// job may not have this new project seeded — so an unset key or a failed call must degrade to a
// clean no-op, not a 500 on the landing or the waitlist route.

// for a shared visitor identity) by however long the call takes, timeout included.

// transition (the ingest route stamping projects.first_event_at) must branch on this: committing
// the "already sent" marker on a send that silently failed loses that funnel stage permanently,
// because no later event ever retries it (cross-review, Codex 2026-07-20).
