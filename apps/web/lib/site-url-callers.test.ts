// site-url-preview-aware · Sprint 1, Story 1.3 — the durable-URL call sites, guarded.
//
// ── What this exists to prevent ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `getSiteUrl()` now returns a PREVIEW deployment's own hostname when `SITE_URL` is absent (epic
// D2). Most of its ~20 call sites are informational — a prompt, a manifest, a sitemap, a
// `metadataBase` — and a preview hostname is exactly what they should show.
//
// A handful are not. They mint a URL that someone KEEPS: the MCP connector URL, a report share
// link, the signup email's `emailRedirectTo`, the auth-callback redirect base. A preview-derived
// URL persisted into one of those dies when the preview is deleted, and the person holding it has
// no way to know why.
//
// Today that cannot happen, and epic D4 records why: every one of those paths is unreachable on a
// preview because its gate — or the database it needs — is scoped to Production only
// (`vercel env ls`, 2026-08-20). `CONNECTOR_ENABLED`, `REPORT_SHARES_ENABLED`, `SIGNUP_ENABLED`,
// `SELF_PROJECT_API_KEY` and `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are all Production-only,
// so a preview has no connector, no shares, no signup, and in fact no database at all.
//
// ── Be precise about what this guard can and cannot see ──────────────────────────────────────
// That safety property has two halves and this test can only hold one of them:
//
//   IN REPO, and asserted below — every file that imports `getSiteUrl` is classified, and every
//   file classified `durable` still USES its declared gate in code. This catches the likely
//   regressions: a NEW durable-URL surface added without anyone thinking about previews, and an
//   existing one losing its gate or reducing it to a dead import. It does NOT prove the gate
//   dominates every path to the URL construction — see the note above that test for why a string
//   check must not pretend to answer a control-flow question.
//
//   OUT OF REPO, and NOT assertable here — the Vercel environment scoping itself. If someone adds
//   `SUPABASE_URL` to Preview scope, every durable path becomes reachable on previews and this test
//   stays green. **That is the change to be careful about**, and it is named here because a guard
//   that pretends to cover it would be worse than one that says plainly that it does not.
//
// The registry is the point as much as the assertion: adding a caller forces a line here, and that
// line forces the question "does this hand someone a URL they keep?".
