 * Cross-review (Codex round 1) flagged that a failed emit is never retried: the transition commits,
 * the event is absent, and every later call returns already-claimed/terminal so nothing re-fires.
 * That is accurate.
 *
 * What it does NOT mean is that state is lost. The `tasks` row holds the truth — status,
 * `claimed_by`, `claimed_at`, `resolved_at`, `resolution` — so a missing event costs a
 * NOTIFICATION, never the fact. The event stream is how a tenant's automation hears about a
 * transition; the table is the record of it. Those are different jobs and only one of them is
 * load-bearing for correctness.
 *
 * A durable emit queue is therefore the wrong answer here: it would be a second outbox in front of
 * the outbox, with its own dispatcher, its own retry budget and its own failure modes, to make an
 * advisory notification exactly-once — for a system whose delivery contract is already explicitly
 * at-LEAST-once. The proportionate answer is that a failure leaves a durable, queryable trace
 * instead of only a log line nobody greps, so "why did our Slack channel miss that resolve?" has an
 * answer. The emit itself is already idempotent (a stable key per task+status), so a future
 * reconciliation pass can replay from these rows without risking duplicates.
 *
 * Recorded as a KNOWN LIMITATION in sprint-2.md rather than silently accepted.

 *

 * ask it concurrently. Only one row can be the oldest, so at most one caller matches, and any
 * caller that runs later still gets the same answer rather than a different one. Idempotent by
