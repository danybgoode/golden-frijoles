// The weld between what `/install` tells a reader to type and what is actually published.
//
// ⚠️ It reads `packages/cli/package.json` off DISK rather than importing it, because D4 forbids
// `apps/web` depending on the CLI package — the dependency runs the other way. A test can look at a
// file that a module may not import, which is what makes the weld possible at all.
//
// The failure this prevents is ordinary: someone renames the binary or the package, every test in
// `packages/cli` still passes (they read the manifest too), and the public install page quietly
// keeps telling the world to run a command that no longer exists.

// while `/install` kept teaching a flag that no longer parses. The claim "one surface" was only

// every verb and every flag it declares — and it is pinned by the CLI's golden test, so it cannot
// drift from the CLI either. Read off DISK, for the same D4 reason as the manifest above.
