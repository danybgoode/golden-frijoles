// pod-report · Sprint 1, Story 1.3 — the horizon view's destination↔epic registry.
//
// Generalizes lib/landing-sections.ts's id/title/epic/status shape (the section↔epic registry that
// makes "flipping one entry flips the badge" true for the public landing). This is the same
// mechanism applied one level up: instead of ONE epic lighting ONE landing section, a horizon
// DESTINATION is an end-state milestone that can be lit by SEVERAL epics — the portfolio-wide "here
// is where we are going" the sprint doc asks for, not a page section — so its state is a three-way
// LIT / PARTIAL / COMING rather than landing-sections' binary live/next. Destinations are drawn from
// references/landing-end-state.md's section map, generalized to the whole roadmap rather than only
// the public page.
//
// Deliberately ZERO framework/server-only imports (no `server-only`, no `next/*`, no Supabase) — the
// same rule roadmap-artifact-schema.ts documents: a pure module a plain `node --test` run can import
// directly must not share a file with a runtime-only import, or the test throws an opaque, unrelated
// error just loading the file. The DB-touching half (resolving a project slug, reading the latest
// artifact) lives next door in app/hub/[projectSlug]/horizon/page.tsx.
