// multi-tenant-activation · Sprint 2, Story 2.1 — deriving a project slug from a signup email.
//
// Deliberately ZERO-IMPORT (no `server-only`, no crypto, no DB) — the same rule lib/flags.ts,
// lib/roles.ts and lib/safe-redirect.ts follow (Roadmap/LEARNINGS.md): a pure helper that a spec
// must assert directly cannot share a file with runtime-only imports, or a plain test runner
// throws an opaque unrelated error just importing it. Uniqueness is the DB's job (a UNIQUE
// constraint plus a retry loop in lib/provisioning.ts); this file only decides SHAPE.

// A slug lands in public URLs (/app/funnel/<slug>/...), so the character set is deliberately
// narrow: lowercase alphanumerics and single inner hyphens, nothing else.
const MIN_SLUG_LENGTH = 3
const MAX_SLUG_LENGTH = 40

// Slugs that must never be handed to a self-serve tenant. Two distinct dangers, both real:
//   • `assertPublicAllowedSlug` (AGENTS rule #2) gates the public demo BY SLUG — a stranger who
//     could register the demo slug would inherit a publicly-readable dashboard. The env-driven
//     demo/self slugs are checked separately at provisioning time (see lib/provisioning.ts);
//     these are the STRUCTURAL reservations that hold regardless of configuration.
//   • a slug that collides with an /app route segment or an obvious impersonation target.

 * email always produces a slug: `provisionTenantForUser` must never fail a confirmed signup just
 * because the address was short.
