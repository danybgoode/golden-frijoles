// golden-frijoles-cli · Sprint 1 — the ONE authorization seam every `/api/v1/cli/*` route enters
// through. There is no second path into these routes and there must not be one.
//
// ── The order is the design, and it is the same order the connector route uses ────────────────
//   gate -> credential shape -> resolve -> (per request) membership
//
// The **gate first**, before any credential-derived work, so `CLI_WRITE_API_ENABLED=false` is a
// real whole-surface kill switch and never becomes a credential-validity oracle: with the surface
// off, a valid token and a garbage one get the identical 404. Every gated route in this repo is
// written this way (`flags/snapshot`, `flags/sync`, the MCP connector) and it is the property that
// breaks first if someone "simplifies" by checking auth before the flag.
//
// ── What a CLI token is allowed to do, in one sentence ────────────────────────────────────────
// Exactly what its holder's console session is allowed to do. `requireCliMember` and
// `requireCliOwner` below call the SAME `getMembership` / `isOwner` that `lib/dashboard-auth.ts`
// calls for a browser session. The PAT replaces the cookie; it does not replace the check.
//
// ── "Not yours" and "not there" are the same answer ───────────────────────────────────────────
// A slug the caller is not a member of returns 404, never 403 — the rule `requireProjectMembership`
// states and AGENTS #10 requires. A 403 would confirm that a foreign project exists, which is how
// slug-guessing becomes tenant enumeration.
