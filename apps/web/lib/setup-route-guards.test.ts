// console-ia-overhaul · Sprint 2, Story 2.3 (D5 / A5) — the authorization boundary, at the source.
//
// ── Why a source guard and not a browser test ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The property is "a member gets a flat 404 from Setup › Keys, exactly as they do from
// /app/keys today". Proving that in a browser needs a SECOND identity — a real member of the same
// project — and three attempts at driving a second context through the login form hung.
//
// This is the better instrument anyway. A browser test proves one route 404s for one member on one
// run; it can also pass for the wrong reason (a missing route, an expired session, a slug that never
// existed) and this repo has shipped exactly that kind of false green before. A source guard proves
// the shape for EVERY route at once and cannot be satisfied accidentally.
//
// Keyed on the module SPECIFIER and the call, not on formatting: LEARNINGS records that a guard
// keyed on syntax is an allow-list of shapes, and that a renamed binding or a differently-written
// import walks straight past it.
