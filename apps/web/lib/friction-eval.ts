//
// ── Why there is no cron here, and why that was the whole point ───────────────────────────────
// The obvious design is a scheduled sweep, like `dispatch-deliveries`. It would need a
// `projects_with_friction_due()` function — a cross-tenant read — and therefore a NEW ROW in
// AGENTS.md's scheduler-exemption registry. That file is explicit that such a row is a deliberate,
// recorded decision and "never inferred by analogy" from an existing one, and that an agent who
// thinks it needs a new exemption almost certainly does not.
//
// It doesn't. Detection runs inside read paths that have ALREADY resolved exactly one tenant, for
// that tenant only (epic README, Amendment 3 — Daniel, 2026-07-26). No cross-tenant read exists to
// exempt. The accepted cost, stated plainly: a friction signal materialises when someone or their
// agent looks, not before. For a queue whose entire purpose is to be pulled, that is the right
// trade — and it is reversible into a cron later without changing anything a caller sees.

 * its own `events` queries. That is a direct violation of AGENTS.md rule #1 — `lib/{tars,north-star,
 * ab}-query.ts` are "the canonical read paths; never re-query `events` ad hoc" — and the finding was
 * right about the consequence, not just the rule. `computeTars` is not a pair of COUNT DISTINCTs: it
 * applies fallback semantics when `adoptedEvent`/`retainedEvent` are absent, anchors the retention
 * window to each user's own adoption, and honours `feature.enabled` by zeroing the targeted set. A
 * hand-rolled count agrees with it only for the simplest feature, and diverges silently for every
 * other — so friction would have fired on numbers no dashboard in the product could reproduce, which
 * is the fastest possible way to destroy trust in the queue.
 *
 * Reusing the seam also means friction inherits future TARS fixes for free, rather than needing the
 * same correction applied twice by someone who remembers both copies exist.
