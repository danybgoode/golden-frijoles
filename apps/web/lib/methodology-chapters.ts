// methodology-experience · Sprint 2, Story 2.1 — the methodology, as one typed module.
//
// ── This file is the SOURCE, not a copy of one (epic D5) ──────────────────────────────────────
// The page, the index cards, the TOC, the route metadata and any downloadable edition all derive
// from here. A hand-maintained markdown twin of this prose would be the exact drift class
// `lib/landing-sections.ts` exists to prevent, and the class this repo has been bitten by three
// times. If you are about to write the methodology down somewhere else, generate it from this.
//
// ── Where the prose came from, and what was WRONG with it ─────────────────────────────────────
// Derived from `references/golden-frijoles-methodology-experience-v0.3.html`, the mockup, which is
// itself a pandoc conversion of the Minimum Viable Field Guide. The conversion left five defects
// that the epic README lists and that a faithful port would have shipped. Four of them are fixed
// here, in the content, because this is where they live:
//
//   1. THE LEDE WAS A RENDERED JAVASCRIPT OBJECT. All six chapters displayed the raw
//      `{1:"…",2:"…",…}[n]` literal as body text — a templating step that never ran. The six real
//      strings were inside that literal all along; each is now its chapter's own `lede`. The unit
//      test asserts no lede contains `{`, because this can only ever regress silently.
//   2. PANDOC HORIZONTAL RULES. Every "What you just learned" block ended with a literal
//      `------------------------------------------------------------------------` paragraph. Gone.
//   3. PANDOC EM-DASHES. The source renders every em-dash as a literal `---` ("Opportunity --- what
//      possibility are we considering?"). Restored to `—`. This one is not in the README's list of
//      five; it is the same conversion failure and it is on every definition line in chapters 2, 5
//      and 6, so it is fixed with them rather than left for a reader to notice.
//   4. A COLLAPSED BULLET LIST. Chapter 3's "Ask: - Does the Opportunity matter? - Is the Outcome a
//      change in reality…" is a real list flattened into one hyphenated paragraph. It is a `list`
//      block again. Chapter 6's Continue/Change/Reduce/Increase/Exit judgments had the same shape.
//
// The fifth defect (the mockup is a `display:none` SPA with no URLs) is not a content problem and
// is fixed by Stories 2.2 and 2.3.
//
// ── Chapter 2 is "Design it" (epic D3) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The rename reaches this content and the public landing, and stops there — `AGENTS.md`,
// `Roadmap/WAYS-OF-WORKING.md` and the `refine` skill keep *Shape* as our internal operating
// vocabulary. It is a copy pass, not a `sed`. Four lines needed real rewriting rather than a swap,
// and each is marked at its call site below with what it used to say.
//
// ── Titles carry no full stop, and that is a decision (Story 2.3) ─────────────────────────────
// The mockup writes them as sentences ("Bring an idea."). They are rendered as the `<h1>` of a
// route, and `scripts/check-design-drift.mjs`'s `heading-period` rule reads the final character of
// heading text — so the stop had to go from the title or the title had to stop being a heading.
// The stop goes. Headings here are titles, not sentences, which is the same rule `MakerHero`'s
// display headline already follows, and the guard is not special-cased.

 * The closing: "You completed the loop" and the Practitioner checkpoint.
 *
 * ── The one line that is NOT the source's ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The v0.2 source reads "You do not need to memorize nine practices to do it again." A reader of
 * this six-chapter edition is never shown nine named practices — the nine moves (Orient · Shape ·
 * Bet · Route · Slice · Bound · Prove · Reconsider · Learn) were deliberately cut as a spec sheet
 * by the predecessor epic, and this edition does not reintroduce them. So the count pointed at a
 * set that does not exist for this reader. That is the version skew Story 2.1 asked about, and the
 * product owner ruled to drop the count (A5).
 *
 * The wording is "a list of practices" rather than the "the deeper vocabulary" first proposed:
 * that phrase reappears verbatim two sentences later ("The deeper vocabulary is there when you need
 * precision"), and the repetition was audible when read aloud. Same decision, better sentence.
 *
 * ── The source's phase recap is DROPPED here, deliberately ───────────────────────────────────
 * v0.2 closes by restating CONSIDER / OPERATE / EXIT with their one-line summaries. That is right
 * for a linear document whose reader has scrolled a long way from the loop. It is wrong for this
 * edition: the index renders the same three lines in its Direction card at the top of the SAME
 * page, from `METHODOLOGY_PHASES`, so repeating them here would print the same list twice — the
 * defect epic D4 exists to prevent, one surface over.
 *
 * A unit test asserts no phase summary is hardcoded in these blocks, so a future edit that
 * reintroduces the recap has to reintroduce it as a DERIVE rather than as a second copy. Dropping
 * it is also what keeps D3's rename ("Bring an idea → Design it → Place the Bet") true here
 * without a second edit: the only copy of that line lives in `METHODOLOGY_PHASES`.
