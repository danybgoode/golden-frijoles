// ── D1: this module RENDERS the inventory; it does not define a second one ────────────────────
// `lib/project-route-inventory.ts` already carries every surface with a label, an audience and a
// gate, and is already unit-tested. The audit read the /app page's bare `<ul>` as "there is no
// information architecture"; there is one, it was simply never presented. A hardcoded list in
// ProductShell would be a duplicate source of truth that drifts the first time a surface is added.
// If the nav ever needs a grouping the inventory cannot express, extend the inventory (with its
// test) — never inline a list here.
//
// ── Tenancy ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The caller passes the slug it is rendering, but that slug is only ever MATCHED against the
// membership list this module reads server-side. A slug the signed-in user is not a member of
// simply does not match, and they get their own default project's sections instead of a foreign
// project's — the request never selects the tenant (AGENTS.md; CODE-QUALITY rule 10).

    //     say so: `header !== null` implies gate-on-and-session, but the converse does not, and this
    //     catch is the sole exception. `getSessionUser()` and `getUserProjects()` are both inside the
    //     `try`, so with the console lit an outage drops a signed-in operator onto the legacy branch,
    //     whose `Connect` goes to `/install` — the demo project's URL.
    //
    // (2) So I changed this to return a console header when the gate is open... which reintroduced
    //     a version of the defect the same reviewer caught one round earlier. `getSessionUser()` is
    //     the first statement in the `try`; if it REJECTS (a transport failure — it returns null for
    //     an ordinary auth error, but a rejection is not that), we land here knowing nothing about
    //     whether a session exists, and the two demo dashboards are anonymously readable and render
    //     this shell.
    //
    //     ⚠️ MEASURED, because the first two versions of this note overstated it: with `EMPTY`'s
    //     null `activeProject` and null `userEmail`, the switcher (`{activeProject && …}`) and the
    //     account menu (`shellRendersAccountMenu`) are both already suppressed. What an anonymous
    //     visitor would actually have got is a logo, a lone "Today" tab and an empty ⌘K palette —
    //     which is still console chrome on a public page, and still wrong, but it is not a switcher
    //     and not an account menu. The accurate version is the one 90 lines above.
    //
    // Trading a bounded Should-fix for a Blocking is the wrong direction. The catch does not know
    // who is asking, so it must return the answer that is safe for BOTH: the public chrome. A
    // signed-in operator seeing `/install` during an outage is a wrong-tenant confusion, bounded
    // (rule #2 means `/install` only ever serves the demo project) and identical to pre-epic
    // behaviour — not something this epic introduced.

    // The right response to "your claim is false" was to fix the CLAIM, not to make a worse change.
    // The claim is fixed in `ProductShell`'s comment instead.
