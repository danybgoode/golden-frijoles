// flags-console-parity · Sprint 1, Story 1.2 (epic README, D1, D1a, D2) — the arithmetic behind the
// feature list.
//
// ── Why this is a NEW module and not more of `lib/data-table.ts` (D2) ─────────────────────────
// `data-table.ts` is generic arithmetic over `CellValue`, written for and frozen alongside the
// `DataTable` island. Three things here are not that:
//   1. The sorts are DOMAIN sorts — by activation state, by polarity, by when this environment last
//      changed — not "sort column X ascending".
//   2. `data-table.ts` has no `paginate`, deliberately, and D4 refuses to grow one.
//   3. The decisive one: **Golden's flag state is per ENVIRONMENT.** The upstream this ports from
//      (`medusa-bonsai` → `lib/flags-admin-view.ts`) has a single global `enabled` per flag, so it
//      could sort and filter the stored rows directly. Golden cannot: the same flag is on in
//      development and never touched in production. So this module PROJECTS first —
//      `(flags, environment) → FlagListRow[]` — and every filter, sort and page runs over that
//      projection. Get that order wrong and every count on the page answers about the wrong
//      environment while looking perfectly plausible.
//
// ── Import-free on purpose ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Same constraint as `data-table.ts` and `format-utc.ts`, and the same one the upstream was written
// under: no React, no `next/*`, no SDK, no database. That is what lets `npm run test:unit` — which
// IS the merge gate — cover the whole of this file with zero DOM, while the component that renders
// it can only be reached through a signed-in browser (outside the gate). `flag-environment-view.ts`
// may import FROM here; this file imports from nothing.
//
// ── A4 / D1: no query is added ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Every field below is already carried by `getFlagRegistryView()`. This file takes plain data, and
// that signature is what makes a stray Supabase call visible as the wrong turn it would be.

/**
 * What one environment is doing with one flag. **Three states, not two.**
 *
 * The distinction between `off` and `never` is the whole of Story 2.3, and it is not cosmetic —

 * Amendment 2 for why the story that was refined ("not created") could not be built.

 * business (D7), not this file's.
 *
 * `unclassified` is D1a. `metadata` is optional in the SDK's `FlagDefinition` and unvalidated by
 * `private.flag_definition_is_valid`, so "the bag has a polarity" is a convention of the Miyagi

 *
 * The approved prototype emits a `.grp` per state TRANSITION with a per-state label and a per-state
 * count, and only when grouped. This is that, moved somewhere it can be unit-tested.
 *
 * Returns `[]` when not grouped — the design shows no headers over an ungrouped list, because a
 * filtered view is already one thing and a heading over it would be restating the filter.
