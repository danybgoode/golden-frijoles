//
// Signals ride the EXISTING /v1/track envelope rather than getting a route of their own — the
// growth-engine-v1 S1.1 `tags`/`metadata` forward-compat was left open for exactly this, so error
// capture needs no schema migration and no second ingest path (AGENTS rule #1).
//
// The reserved event NAMES live in lib/signal-events.ts, a zero-import module, and are re-exported
// here for callers that already depend on this file. See that file's header for why they cannot
// live in this one: it imports `server-only`, which breaks any test runner that touches it.

/**
 * Redacts a reserved `$error` event's tags/metadata BEFORE the event itself is persisted.
 *
 * ── Why this exists, and why it is not gated by SIGNALS_ENABLED ─────────────────────────────
 * Found by cross-review (Codex, 2026-07-26) and REPRODUCED against a real database before being
 * accepted: the first version of this epic scrubbed only on the way into `signals`, while
 * `ingest_event` had already written the caller's RAW tags into `events`. A hand-rolled client
 * posting `{"event":"$error","tags":{"message":"failed with gb_key_…"}}` got a clean signal row and
 * a permanent plaintext credential in `events.tags`. The e2e spec missed it completely because it
 * asserted against the `signals` table — the right property, checked in the wrong place.
 *
 * Two consequences shape this function:
 *
 * 1. It runs on the INGEST path, before persistence, so there is no window in which the raw payload
 *    exists at rest. `events` is append-only for the service role, so a leak here is not something a
 *    later cleanup could fully undo.
 *
 * 2. It is deliberately NOT behind `SIGNALS_ENABLED`. That flag gates whether we GROUP signals; it
 *    must not decide whether we redact credentials. Otherwise turning the seam off — the thing an
 *    operator does when something looks wrong — would silently start storing raw secrets, which is
 *    the exact inversion of what a kill switch is for.

 * Ingest's contract is that a stored event is stored. Grouping is a DERIVED projection of an event
 * that has already been committed — so a grouping failure must cost the tenant a signal row, never
 * their event, and never a 500 on a write that actually succeeded. This is the same reasoning the
 * outbox encodes one layer down: turning delivery off must lose no events, only stop them moving.
 *
 * `after()` rather than a bare floating promise: on a serverless runtime an un-awaited promise can
 * be killed when the response is returned, which would make grouping silently probabilistic. The
 * commercial-shell S3 review found precisely that bug in a different route.
 *
 * The flag is read HERE rather than at the call site so there is exactly one place that decides
 * whether the signals seam is live — a second copy is a second thing to forget.
