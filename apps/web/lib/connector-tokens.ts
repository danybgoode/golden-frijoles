 * against production is his, by name.**
 *
 * ── Refuses when one is already active, and that is not politeness ────────────────────────────
 * Rotation is revoke-then-mint, two deliberate acts, rather than a mint that quietly leaves a live
 * key behind it.
 *
 * ⚠️ **This check is NOT atomic, and the application cannot make it so.** It is a check-then-act
 * with no unique index behind it: two concurrent mints both see "none active" and both insert.
 * Cross-review (agy) raised this as Blocking, correctly.
 *
 * What makes it survivable is on the READ side — `getConnectorStatus` returns every active token, so
 * a duplicate is *visible and revocable* rather than a live credential hidden behind a `LIMIT 1`.
 * That was the actual danger; two visible URLs is a mess an owner can clean up, one invisible one is
 * not. A credential you cannot see is a credential you cannot revoke.
 *
 * ✅ **CLOSED at the database, 2026-08-27.** Daniel authorized the migration;
 * `20260827120000_connector_token_uniqueness.sql` adds a PARTIAL unique index on `(project_id)
 * WHERE revoked_at IS NULL`, applied to production BEFORE the merge that deploys this code. Verified
 * by attempting the forbidden write against production and watching it be rejected — and by
 * confirming rotation (revoke, then mint) is still permitted, which a plain `UNIQUE (project_id)`
 * would have broken.
 *
 * So the race is now impossible rather than merely survivable. The `already-active` pre-check stays
 * because it produces a readable sentence; the index is what makes the guarantee true.
 * The caller re-checks ownership AND `CONNECTOR_ENABLED` before reaching here (AGENTS rule #3: the
 * two kill switches are independent, and minting the second must never route around the first).
