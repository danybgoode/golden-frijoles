// console-ia-overhaul · Sprint 2, Story 2.3 — one answer to "what has access to this project?"
//
// ── Why a projection module and not four tables on a page ─────────────────────────────────────
// The four credential kinds have four different row shapes (`ApiKeyRow` has no expiry at all;
// `FlagReadKeyRow` carries an environment; `FlagSyncKeyRow` carries a source). Rendering them as
// four tables would be the four existing pages stacked vertically, which answers "which subsystem
// minted this" — the question the story says nobody should have to ask. One list needs one shape.
//
// It is pure and lives here so the WORDS are testable. The story's actual deliverable is the
// "what it may do" column in plain language, and words on a credential surface belong where the
// merge gate can read them, not inside a client island only a signed-in browser can reach
// (`flags-console-parity` put its load-bearing sentences in `lib/flag-console-copy.ts` for exactly
// this reason).

 *   · `flag_sync` and `agent_write` are the design's own words, unchanged.
 *   · `ingest` has none to borrow — the prototype has no ingest row at all, and "Read the numbers"
 *     is what its two READ keys say. "Send events" is what this kind actually authorises, and
 *     captioning it "Read the numbers" would be wrong rather than merely different.
 *   · `flag_read` is "Read the flags", not the design's "Read the numbers", because in THIS product
 *     "the numbers" is the funnel and the North Star — which is what an ingest key reads. Two kinds
 *     captioned "Read the numbers" would say that a snapshot key can read a project's metrics. It
