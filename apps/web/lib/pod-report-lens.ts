// pod-report · Sprint 2.5b — the audience lens.
//
// Three audiences read the same artifact and must not read the same page: the team wants every
// row, a client wants their own pod's picture without our internal build minutiae, an investor
// wants the shape of the thing without per-story internals (epic README, Decision 3).
//
// ── Zero imports, on purpose ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// This is the policy Sprint 3's share links enforce on data they hand to people outside the
// company, and a policy that can only be tested through HTTP is a policy whose branches never get
// exercised (Roadmap/LEARNINGS.md — multi-tenant-activation S1 shipped four security specs that
// passed identically against a deliberately re-broken build, because the guard sat behind an auth
// precondition the harness could not satisfy). Everything here is a pure function over plain data,
// so a unit test reaches every branch directly and a mutation check has something to break.
//
// ── The invariant this module exists to make structural ───────────────────────────────────────
// A lens narrows DETAIL. A lens may never narrow HONESTY. The not-instrumented rows, the caveats
// and the verdict's not-instrumented count survive every lens, including the investor one — which
// is the lens most tempting to flatter and the one Story 2.4's acceptance criteria name explicitly.
// `applyLens` is written so that dropping them is not a thing a caller can ask for: they are copied
// unconditionally, outside any per-lens branch.
