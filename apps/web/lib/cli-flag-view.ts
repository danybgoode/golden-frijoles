// golden-frijoles-cli · Sprint 1, Story 1.5 — the agent-facing projection of the flag registry.
//
// ── This file derives NOTHING it could ask for ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// "Is production serving this?" is answered by `resolveActivationState`, and "what does it serve?"
// by `evaluateVersionDefault`, both lifted straight from the console's own view layer. That is not
// tidiness; it is the same argument D4 makes about the command core. The console learned the hard
// way that an activation row pointing at a version does NOT mean "on" — 34 of one project's 42
// flags have a latest version that evaluates to `false` — and a CLI that re-derived "on" from the
// presence of an activation row would print the exact wrong word for most flags in production,
// confidently, in a format an agent is meant to trust.
//
// So: zero clause comparisons, zero activation arithmetic, zero variant lookups in this file. Grep
// it. It reshapes answers other modules give.
//
// ── The shape is a CONTRACT (D5) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Everything below is pinned by a golden file in `packages/cli`. Renaming a field here is a
// breaking change to every agent scraping `--json`, and the golden file is what makes that fact
// arrive in review instead of in someone's pipeline.
