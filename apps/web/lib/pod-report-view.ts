// No `server-only` or `next/*` imports, so the presentation decisions below are unit-testable
// without a server (Roadmap/LEARNINGS.md). The Supabase read reuses `lib/report-artifacts.ts`,
// which already returns `payload` and nothing derived.

// ── The one rule this file exists to enforce ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Speed is NEVER rendered without stability and honesty beside it. DORA-2025's own finding, and
// the epic's Decision 4: "the report that only shows speed is the vendor-ware our audience smells."
// So `buildPodReportView` returns metrics and gaps from the SAME call — a renderer physically
// cannot map over the numbers while forgetting the caveats, because they arrive together.
