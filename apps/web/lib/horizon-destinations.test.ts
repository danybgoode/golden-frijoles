// the one where it must refuse to claim: `lit` has to be unreachable unless every contributing epic
// is genuinely shipped. Over-claiming ✅ is the single failure the poster rule forbids outright
// (under-claiming is merely untidy), and here it would mean showing an investor a destination as
// reached when it is not.
