# Agent index — Golden Beans

## What is this?

**Golden Beans is a standalone Unified Growth Engine** — telemetry ingest + a TypeScript SDK, a TARS
funnel (Targeted/Adopted/Retained), a North Star metric, and A/B bucketing, wrapped in a commercial
shell (public landing, waitlist, and a read-only MCP connector). It is **multi-tenant by design**:
the **tenant is the workspace** — every event is scoped to a `project`, every project lives in exactly
one `workspace`, and **no request-derived read path can cross workspaces**. Projects inside one
workspace may be read together by its members **only through `getWorkspaceProjects()`** — see
[§ The tenancy invariant](#the-tenancy-invariant-workspace-level). (One narrow, registered exemption
exists for background schedulers — see
[§ The scheduler exemption](#the-scheduler-exemption-narrow-registered-and-property-bound); it does
not apply to anything that serves a request.) It exists so a team can
run product analytics + experimentation from one primitive set instead of stitching vendors together;
its first proof-of-use is dogfooding Miyagi's real setup-guide funnel. It is *not* a fork of any
sibling project — it's maintained on its own, consuming the shared `golden-frijoles` plugin for process.

**Architecture**: **Next.js App Router (`apps/web`) + Supabase Postgres**, deployed on **Vercel**
(merge to `main` = deploy). Supabase is accessed **service-role only, server-side** — RLS is ON with
no anon policies; every query is `project_id`-scoped, and that `project_id` is always resolved
**server-side** — from the request's hashed API key (`lib/auth.ts`) on authed ingest/read paths, or
from an allow-listed demo slug (`lib/public-demo.ts`, rule #2) / a revocable connector token
(`lib/connector-tokens.ts`, rule #3) on the public/connector paths — **never from the request body**.
A framework-agnostic TypeScript SDK lives in `packages/sdk`.

```

**Business-sensitive docs** (a client's own plans or contracts, commercial or spin-out strategy, audits naming
customers) do **not** go in this public repo: they live in the private `golden-frijoles/internal`, and a pointer is
left here (public-monorepo D7).

**Workflow (gitflow)**: work on a **feature branch** (`feat/<epic-slug>`), commit per story, open a
**PR**, and **merge to `main`** when verified + approved. Merging to `main` is the deploy — Vercel's
GitHub integration auto-deploys `main` to production on every merge, no manual step. **Never run
`vercel deploy`/`vercel deploy --prod` from the CLI** — that's an out-of-band deploy that bypasses
the git-tracked pipeline and isn't how this project ships; if a deployment looks stuck or wrong,
check `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/deployments` (confirms which commit SHA is actually live) or the
Vercel dashboard, don't reach for a CLI deploy to "fix" it. **Env vars require a REDEPLOY to reach running functions — corrected 2026-07-21.** An earlier
version of this file claimed the opposite ("took effect on the already-deployed production
functions with no redeploy needed", from commercial-shell Sprint 2). That was **disproved
empirically** during the multi-tenant-activation launch: `SIGNUP_ENABLED=true` was added to the
Production scope with `vercel env add ... --value true`, and `/signup` still returned 404 more than
seven minutes later, because Vercel snapshots env vars into a deployment at build time and the
running functions kept serving the values captured at their own build. **Adding or changing a var
is only half the job — a new deployment (i.e. a commit to `main`) is what makes it live.** Verify
by exercising the behaviour the var controls, never by `vercel env ls` (which never shows values). Two gotchas hit while confirming this: (1) `vercel env add`
piped from `echo -n "..." |` can silently save an **empty** value — always verify with `--value
<val>` explicitly, and check the live behavior it's supposed to affect (e.g. render the page that
reads it), not just `vercel env ls` (which never shows values) or `vercel env pull` (unreliable for
sensitive-flagged vars — mark anything non-secret `--no-sensitive` at creation); (2) a **local**
checkout's `node_modules` can go stale after pulling a merge that added a dependency — `npm ci`
before trusting a local build failure. **Supabase migrations are a separate step, not part of the
Vercel deploy** — `supabase link --project-ref <ref>` (find the ref via `supabase projects list`)
then `supabase migration list` (diffs local vs. remote); pending ones are applied by an agent through
the Supabase MCP `apply_migration` tool, or by the product owner running `supabase db push` by hand —
**`supabase db push` is on the committed deny list** (`.claude/settings.json`, 2026-09-16) so an
unattended agent cannot replay migrations; nothing here happens automatically on merge. Roll back a bad merge with `git revert` on
`main`.

## Start here (orientation for any agent)

Before planning or building, read these — they are the source of truth and change often:
- **`Roadmap/README.md`** (product source of truth, one level above this file if nested under an app)
  — the product poster: every feature by domain, current status.
- **`Roadmap/WAYS-OF-WORKING.md`** — how we plan/build/ship: the cadence, gitflow, Definition of Done
  (story **and** epic), QA/smoke-test rules, the test harness. Follow it.
- **`CODE-QUALITY.md`** (repo root) — the house style: what "good" looks like here, as opposed to
  what is *forbidden* (that's the rules below). Short by design, one rule per thing that has
  actually cost us something. **Read it before writing code**; it is the review you would otherwise
  get. Note for agent tooling: this file (`AGENTS.md`) is auto-loaded into Codex's context by
  convention, `CODE-QUALITY.md` is not — `scripts/codex-task.mjs` injects it into every delegated
  brief, and a human-driven session should open it explicitly.
- **`Roadmap/LEARNINGS.md`** — the distilled, cross-cutting wisdom from past epics' retrospectives
  (multi-agent + async-deploy coordination, tooling gotchas, what's worked). **Read it** — it's how a
  past retro reaches you instead of dying in its epic folder. You feed it at epic close (see the epic
  Definition of Done).
- **Team memory** (if your tooling keeps one) — durable facts: deploy topology, per-epic notes,
  gotchas.
- Process: **plan first** (plan mode → user stories → product-owner approves) → branch + **scaffold
  the epic/sprint docs before code** → build one story → verify → **smoke-test** → PR → merge. At
  **epic close**, update `Roadmap/README.md` (the poster), write a `RETROSPECTIVE.md`, and **promote
  its durable learnings to `Roadmap/LEARNINGS.md`**.

## ⚠️ The rules that cannot be violated

### 1. The growth engine (Supabase-backed ingest/registry/TARS/North Star/experiments) owns telemetry. Never build a parallel pipeline.
If a feature needs to track an event, define a feature, read a funnel, or compare an experiment, it goes
through the existing primitives — `/api/v1/track`, `/api/v1/features/sync`, the TARS/North Star/A-B query
libs (`apps/web/lib/{tars,north-star,ab}*.ts`) — via the real `@golden-frijoles/sdk` client. Do not insert
directly into `events`/`features` from application code, and do not stand up a second event table or a
bespoke analytics route for something this system already models.

| Concern | Where it lives |
|---|---|
| Event ingest | `POST /api/v1/track` (`apps/web/app/api/v1/track/route.ts`) |
| Feature/signal registry | `POST /api/v1/features/sync` (`apps/web/lib/feature-schema.ts`) |
| Funnel / North Star / experiment reads | `apps/web/lib/{tars,north-star,ab}-query.ts` |
| Event catalog (what the product sends) | `apps/web/lib/event-catalog-query.ts` |
| Client SDK | `packages/sdk` (`createGrowthEngineClient`) |

### 2. `/api/v1/public/*` may only ever serve the demo project. Never widen it.
The public landing's live-proof section and any other public read route are gated by
`assertPublicAllowedSlug()` (`apps/web/lib/public-demo.ts`) against `DEMO_PROJECT_SLUG`. A real customer
project (e.g. `miyagisanchez`) must 403, not 404, on these routes. Any new public-facing read path reuses
this same allow-list check — never a route that trusts a caller-supplied project slug.
**Unchanged by the workspace-level invariant (2026-10-01):** the allow-list names one PROJECT, and the workspace
that project sits in widens nothing — see [§ The tenancy invariant](#the-tenancy-invariant-workspace-level).
**The one public project is Golden Frijoles' own (one-product-project D1, 2026-10-08):** `golden-frijoles` (formerly
the synthetic `golden-beans-demo`), built in the open. Its funnels, North Star, roadmap and flags are public; its
administration is members-only, and an anonymous reader of its connector never sees a person's id
(`lib/public-connector-scrub.ts`). `npm run seed:demo` refuses any non-local database: its reset deletes the
project's events and features.

### 3. The MCP connector is enablement-gated. Never bypass either gate as a shortcut.
The `connector.mcp_enabled` gate (`apps/web/lib/flags.ts → isConnectorEnabled`, a catalog flag — rule #6) and per-project revocable tokens
(`connector_tokens`, `apps/web/lib/connector-tokens.ts`) are two independent kill switches — the route
must 404 while the flag is off regardless of token validity, and a revoked token must fail regardless of
the flag. Never hardcode the flag to `true`, and never add a connector code path that skips the token
check "temporarily."

### 4. Merging to `main` is the deploy. Never run a manual `vercel deploy`/`--prod`.
Vercel's GitHub integration auto-deploys `main` on every merge — see "Workflow (gitflow)" above. If a
deployment looks stuck or wrong, confirm via `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/deployments` (exact commit SHA +
status per environment), never via a CLI deploy.

**Env vars REQUIRE a redeploy to reach running functions**, and the redeploy must be a **commit to
`main`** — not `vercel redeploy`/`--prod`, which this rule forbids. Vercel snapshots env vars into a
deployment at build time, so setting a var is only half the job. (An earlier copy of this line
claimed the opposite; it was corrected in the "Workflow" section on 2026-07-21 but this second copy
survived until 2026-07-22 — see LEARNINGS' "grep for its siblings" rule, which is exactly what
should have caught it.) Confirmed again 2026-07-22: `CRON_SECRET` was invisible to the running
functions until a new deployment.

### The tenancy invariant (workspace level)

**Approved by Daniel as audit decision D5 (2026-09-23), enacted by the workspaces epic (2026-10-01)** — in the same
change that introduced the `workspaces` table, because a comment cannot amend an architecture rule.

**The rule:** *no tenant (workspace) observes another's data.* Projects inside one workspace may be read
**together** by that workspace's members, and **only through `getWorkspaceProjects(userId, workspaceId)`**
(`apps/web/lib/workspace.ts`: the projects of that workspace ∩ the caller's project memberships, and nothing unless
the caller belongs to the workspace; empty on any error). Every other request path stays single-project: it reads exactly one `project_id`, resolved
server-side, exactly as before.

**One named carve-out, and it is not a data read:** `getUserProjects(userId)` (`lib/membership.ts`) lists the caller's
OWN memberships — the id, slug, role and workspace of each project they belong to — so the switcher, `/app` and
`gf projects` can offer a choice. It returns nothing FROM inside those projects, and it drops any project whose
workspace is not one of the caller's. Anything that reads events, metrics, flags
or any other project data from several projects is a multi-project read and goes through `getWorkspaceProjects()`.

- **The workspace is a boundary, not a grant** (access model A). `project_members` is still the access list: a
  workspace member cannot open a project they are not a member of. `workspace_members.role` gates workspace
  administration only, and nothing reads it for project access.
- **Every project-access read re-checks the workspace** at the one seam all of them pass through,
  `lib/membership.ts` (all three reads, through `isInsideViewerWorkspaces` in `lib/workspace-access.ts`). A project
  whose workspace is not one of the caller's is "not found", never "forbidden". A `project_members` insert places the
  person inside the project's workspace (the `project_members_join_workspace` trigger), so the re-check never takes
  away access `project_members` grants; it denies a person REMOVED from a workspace everything inside it.
- **A guard watches it:** the semantic-lint rule `tenancy` (`golden-frijoles.config.json → lint.rules`, in shadow)
  asks about request-path code that reads several projects outside `getWorkspaceProjects()`.
- **Credentials stay project-scoped.** An API key, a connector token or a share link resolves to ONE project and
  never reaches its siblings, workspace or no workspace.
- **Rule #2 is unchanged and is not widened by this.** `/api/v1/public/*` serves the demo project only. That the
  demo and another project share a workspace makes nothing else public, and no public path reads a workspace.
- **This is not a scheduler exemption and does not create one.** A multi-project read on a request path that does
  not go through `getWorkspaceProjects()` is a violation of this rule, whatever it is for.

### The scheduler exemption (narrow, registered, and property-bound)

**Approved by Daniel 2026-07-22** (event-destination-router S2). Read this whole section before
citing it. It is deliberately hard to qualify for.

**"Tenant" here means the workspace** ([§ The tenancy invariant](#the-tenancy-invariant-workspace-level),
2026-10-01). The six conditions and the registry below are unchanged; an exempt function still returns bare
`project_id`s and nothing else.

**The invariant is unchanged in substance:** *no tenant may ever observe another tenant's data.* What
this amendment corrects is an over-broad *wording* — "no read path can cross projects" also caught
background schedulers, which serve no tenant and return no tenant data. The fix scopes the invariant
to **request-derived** paths and permits a *registered* scheduler fan-in.

**Why an exemption rather than a redesign:** a scheduler must decide *which tenants have due work*
before any per-tenant work can start. That question is inherently cross-tenant — moving it to an
external scheduler **relocates** the cross-tenant read, it does not remove it, while adding a second
deployment surface, its own auth and its own failure modes. That trades real robustness for nominal
compliance.

**ALL SIX conditions must hold. Failing any one voids the exemption:**

1. **No request can reach it.** It runs only from a platform scheduler (cron). If any user request,
   API key, session or MCP call can reach the code path, it is *not* exempt — no exceptions for
   "internal" or "admin" routes.
2. **It returns tenant IDENTIFIERS only** — bare `project_id`s. Never tenant *data*: no names, slugs,
   counts, aggregates, timestamps, event fields, destination fields or metadata. **One extra column
   voids the exemption** and requires re-approval.
3. **Service-role only, enforced at the database** — `REVOKE ALL … FROM PUBLIC, anon, authenticated`
   then `GRANT EXECUTE … TO service_role`, pinned by a spec that asserts a *function-level* denial
   (not an RLS error, which would mean EXECUTE leaked and the body ran).
4. **The caller authenticates with a platform secret and fails closed** (`CRON_SECRET`; unset ⇒ 401).
5. **Everything downstream is strictly single-tenant, and single-PROJECT** — the work it schedules takes a **required**
   `projectId` and re-asserts it on every query and write.
6. **It is listed in the registry below.** The exempt set is finite and auditable. Adding to it is a
   deliberate decision by Daniel, recorded here — never inferred by analogy.

**Registry of exempt functions (complete):**

| Function | Returns | Caller |
|---|---|---|
| `projects_with_due_work()` (`20260724100000_delivery_retry.sql`) | `project_id` only | `app/api/internal/dispatch-deliveries` (cron, `CRON_SECRET`-gated) |

**This exemption does NOT permit — do not cite it for any of these:**

- ❌ Any cross-tenant read on a path that serves a request — including "internal" API routes, admin
  screens, the MCP connector, or anything reachable with a session or API key.
- ❌ Cross-tenant reporting, analytics, dashboards, exports or "just a count across tenants."
- ❌ Returning tenant data (even one name or number) from an exempt function.
- ❌ Cross-tenant `JOIN`s in any tenant-facing query, for performance or convenience.
- ❌ Reading another tenant's row "to check something" before acting on your own.
- ❌ Treating this as precedent. A new scheduler needs its own approval and its own registry row.

**If you are an agent and you think you need a new exemption: you almost certainly do not.** Scope
the query to a `project_id` resolved server-side. If you genuinely cannot, stop and put an explicit
either/or decision to Daniel — **a comment or a commit message cannot amend this rule.**

### 5. Site/base URLs never fall back to a request Host header.
`getSiteUrl()` (`apps/web/lib/site-url.ts`) reads `SITE_URL` or falls back to a hardcoded
`localhost:3000` — never `req.headers.get('host')` (Roadmap/LEARNINGS.md: a bare-container Host-header
fallback can silently build a broken URL from a garbage header, dangerous on any redirect/URL-building
path). Any new code that builds an absolute URL from the running request reuses this helper instead of
deriving its own fallback.


### 6. A gate is a Golden Frijoles flag, never an env var.
**one-product-project D3 (Daniel, 2026-10-08):** every product gate is a flag in the `golden-frijoles` catalog, read
through ONE seam — `lib/gates.ts` (the table is `lib/gates-decision.ts → GATES`: key · the env var it replaced ·
fallback). `gf flags kill <key> --env production` is the switch: no Vercel variable and no redeploy, landing within
the seam's 30 s cache. A new gate is a `GATES` row plus `gf flags create <key> --kill-switch|--enablement --all-envs`
(activation is its own step — `gf flags get <key>` must not print `—` in production). Never add a
`process.env.*_ENABLED` read (`lib/gates-guard.test.ts` fails CI), and always `await` a gate: a bare call is a
Promise, which is always truthy. Off Vercel (CI, local) a set env var still overrides, so `ci/gates.*.env` drive the
test servers; on Vercel the env is never read. `FLAG_SERVING_ENABLED` and `CLI_WRITE_API_ENABLED` were retired, not
moved (D2): they gated the control plane that would turn them back on, so they are always on and roll back with
`git revert`.

```

**Key env vars** (all on `apps/web`, set in Vercel):
- **Supabase** — `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (service-role, server-only; `lib/supabase.ts` throws if missing).
- **URLs** — `SITE_URL` (absolute-URL base; `lib/site-url.ts` — never a Host-header fallback, rule #5).
- **Tenancy** — `DEMO_PROJECT_SLUG` (default `golden-frijoles`: the one public project, Golden Frijoles' own) and `SELF_PROJECT_SLUG` (defaults to it — self-tracking lands in the same project); `SELF_PROJECT_API_KEY` (that project's ingest key); `DEMO_PROJECT_API_KEY`, `DEMO_CONNECTOR_TOKEN` (local seeding only).
- **Gates are NOT env vars** (rule #6) — they are flags in the `golden-frijoles` catalog, listed in
  `lib/gates-decision.ts → GATES` and by `gf flags ls --project golden-frijoles`. The `*_ENABLED` names survive only
  as off-Vercel test overrides (`ci/gates.*.env`). Every other var above still needs a commit to `main` to reach
  running functions (rule #4).
- **Tenancy limits are DATA, not env** — `projects.monthly_event_quota` / `projects.ingest_rate_per_min`
  (`lib/quota.ts`); raising a customer's ceiling is an `UPDATE`, never a deploy.

**Key imports** (reuse before rebuild — the load-bearing `lib/` seams):
- `lib/supabase.ts` → `getSupabaseServiceClient()` — the ONLY DB client (service-role, server-only).
- `lib/auth.ts` — hashed-key → `project_id` resolution. Every authed route starts here.
- `lib/membership.ts` — session/PAT user → project access, re-checked against the user's workspaces. Every console, CLI and MCP user check passes here.
- `lib/workspace.ts` → `getWorkspaceProjects()` — the ONLY multi-project read on a request path (§ The tenancy invariant).
- `lib/gates.ts` / `lib/flags.ts` — the ONE gate seam: every product gate from the catalog (rule #6).
- `lib/rate-limit.ts` — DB-backed, serverless-safe bounded writes for any public write route.
- `lib/site-url.ts` → `getSiteUrl()` — the ONLY absolute-URL builder (rule #5).
- `lib/public-demo.ts` → `assertPublicAllowedSlug()` — the demo-only gate for any public read (rule #2).
- `lib/{tars,north-star,ab}-query.ts` — the canonical read paths; never re-query `events` ad hoc.
- `lib/event-catalog-query.ts` — the canonical project-scoped event catalog read.
- `packages/sdk` → `createGrowthEngineClient` — the ONLY app→engine path for tracking (rule #1).
