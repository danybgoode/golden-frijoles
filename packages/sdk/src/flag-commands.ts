// golden-frijoles-cli · D4 — the shared command core. One function per verb, ZERO I/O.
//
// ── What this module is, and what it deliberately is not ──────────────────────────────────────
// It is a PLANNER. Each `plan*` function takes already-parsed input plus (for the verbs that
// change an existing flag) the definition currently being served, and returns the definition that
// should be written next and the environments it should be activated in. It never fetches, never
// reads an environment variable, never touches disk, and never talks to a database. The I/O lives
// in `packages/cli/src/api.ts` and in the route handlers.
//
// ── Why it lives in the SDK and not in packages/cli (the whole of D4) ─────────────────────────
// The CLI and the MCP write tools must not drift. The MCP tools live in `apps/web`, which already
// depends on `@golden-frijoles/sdk` and must not start depending on the CLI; the CLI cannot import
// from `apps/web` at all. The SDK is the one place both sides can reach, so putting the planners
// here is what makes parity STRUCTURAL rather than a review checklist: `frijoles flags kill` and the
// `kill_flag` MCP tool call the same function, so they cannot disagree about what killing a flag
// means. A spec in Sprint 3 asserts plan equality for the same input, and it is only meaningful
// because there is one implementation to compare against itself.
//
// ── Why every plan re-runs the parser (D2's rule, restated) ───────────────────────────────────
// `parseFlagDefinition` is the authority on what is valid, server-side, on every write. These
// planners run it too — not as a second validator, but so a caller gets the parser's own errors
// BEFORE a network call, and so a plan can never emit a definition the backend would reject. Where
// the two could drift this side is stricter, which is the safe direction.
//
// ── The caps are READ, never retyped ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// MAX_FLAG_RULES / MAX_FLAG_CLAUSES / MAX_FLAG_VARIANTS come from ./flags. The SDK's own header
// says why: a client that caps at a literal 20 disagrees with the parser the first time the parser
// changes, and it disagrees SILENTLY, by refusing input the backend would have accepted.
