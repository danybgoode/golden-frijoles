# @golden-frijoles/cli

Create a feature flag in every environment, roll it out, and kill it — from a terminal, or from an
agent. No browser, no human click.

```bash
npx @golden-frijoles/cli --version
```

## The one-minute version

```bash
npm i -g @golden-frijoles/cli          # or use npx for everything below

frijoles login                                # opens your browser to sign this machine in
frijoles init                                 # project + key + .env.local + the snippet
frijoles flags create checkout.demo_enabled --kill-switch --all-envs
frijoles flags rollout checkout.demo_enabled --env production --percent 25
frijoles flags kill checkout.demo_enabled --env production
```

## Why this exists

Every high-risk change ships behind a flag, and a flag is invisible until it exists **in the
provider**. Before this, the one line of a release that most needs to be reliable — *create the flag
in every environment* — was the line that stopped and waited for someone to open a browser.

`frijoles flags create … --all-envs` is that line.

## Signing in

At a terminal, `frijoles login` opens your browser: confirm the code it shows and this machine is signed in.

```bash
frijoles login                # browser sign-in
frijoles whoami               # who you are, which credential, which projects
```

Without a browser, mint a token at **`/app/setup/cli`** and pipe it in (`echo "$TOKEN" | frijoles login`); a piped or
pasted token is read from stdin, never from argv or your history. `--token <token>` also works, but it lands in argv
and your shell history, so prefer the pipe.

In CI, set `GOLDEN_FRIJOLES_TOKEN` and skip `frijoles login` entirely. Nothing is written to disk on that
path.

A token signs you in as **you**: it can do exactly what your console session can do, across every
project you are a member of, and nothing more. Revoke it at `/app/setup/cli`.

## Polarity — the thing to get right

A flag's polarity decides what it serves the day it is born, and the CLI derives everything else
from it, so the wrong combination is not expressible:

| You type | Default variant | Every environment serves | Reach for it when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--kill-switch` | `on` | `true` | it is **on** until you kill it |
| `--enablement` | `off` | `false` | you will **open** it deliberately later |

Both polarities **activate in every environment you name.** "Created disabled" means *serving
`false`*, not *absent* — a flag that is not activated is missing from the snapshot, so your app falls
back to its own literal and the flag is invisible in the provider, which is the failure this tool
exists to end.

## `--all-envs`, and what happens when one fails

Three environments, three writes, no transaction. So:

- each environment is written **idempotently**,
- you get a **per-environment report**, and
- the exit code is **5** if any environment failed.

Never a silent partial.

## `--json` everywhere

Every command takes `--json`. Under it, **stdout carries exactly one JSON document and nothing
else** — no progress lines, no warnings. A failure is a JSON document too, on stdout, with a stable
`code`:

```json
{ "ok": false, "code": "not_found", "error": "No project `acme` is available to this account." }
```

`--help` output and these envelopes are pinned by golden-file tests. They do not change on a copy
edit.

## Sending a North Star: `frijoles north-star set`

The North Star chapter of the `strategy` skill (Golden Frijoles plugin) leaves `Roadmap/00-strategy/north-star.md`, with the metric and
its inputs in one ```json block under `## Sync payload`. This command sends that block to your project:

```bash
frijoles north-star set Roadmap/00-strategy/north-star.md          # dry run: shows what would change, sends nothing
frijoles north-star set Roadmap/00-strategy/north-star.md --yes    # sends it once (project owners only)
```

A sync never replaces or deletes. A new metric key is **added** beside an existing North Star, and an input key that
already exists **moves** to this metric. The dry run says so before anything is sent, and to revise a North Star you
reuse its key. The server validates the block and prints its `issues` on a 400. A file that still has the template's
`<…>` placeholders is refused before anything is sent.

## Reading a result: `frijoles north-star readings`, `frijoles experiments decision`

An agent reading an epic's result (the plugin's `epic-read`) fetches the number itself through these two reads. Any
project member can run them; `--json` prints the body the agent parses.

```bash
frijoles north-star readings grounded_bets_share --to 2026-11-04 --json   # the input's readings; `latest` is the number
frijoles experiments decision smart-defaults --json                        # the experiment's decision record
```

`latest` is the last reading on or before `--to`; an input with no reading yet says so rather than reporting zero.
Cite them as `north-star:<input>@<latest.date>` and `ab:<experiment>`.

## Exit codes

| Code | Name | Means |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | ok | it worked |
| `1` | usage | the command is wrong — nothing was sent |
| `2` | auth | the credential is not accepted — run `frijoles login` |
| `3` | not-found | no such thing, or not yours |
| `4` | conflict | someone else changed it — re-read and retry |
| `5` | partial | some environments changed and some did not |
| `6` | server | the server or the network is unwell — retry |

## When something is wrong

```bash
frijoles doctor
```

It runs without a credential — diagnosing a missing one is the point — and reports every check it
could run: the credentials file, the credential, its shape, whether the deployment answers, whether
it accepts you, whether your active project is reachable, and whether this CLI is current. It never
prints key material.

Then one line per module (Plan, Build, Ship, Measure, Spend, Operate): *configured*, *not
configured* (with the command that fixes it) or *could not look*. Module lines never change the
exit code.

## Settings: `frijoles setup` and `frijoles config`

```bash
frijoles setup                                   # two questions, each with a default; --yes takes them all
frijoles config list                             # every setting, and which file it came from
frijoles config get review.reviewScope
frijoles config set review.reviewScope every-pr
```

Settings live in the project's `golden-frijoles.config.json`, the same file the Golden Frijoles
skills read and write: these verbs use the config core that ships in `@golden-frijoles/kit`, so
there is one set of rules. `set` refuses anything that looks like a secret (keep those in
`.env.local`), and legacy files such as `review-config.json` are read but never edited. None of these
verbs needs a credential.

## Environment

| Variable | What it does |
|---|---|
| `GOLDEN_FRIJOLES_TOKEN` | a CLI token; wins over the saved credential. The CI path. |
| `GOLDEN_FRIJOLES_URL` | the deployment to talk to |
| `GOLDEN_FRIJOLES_PROJECT` | the active project |

`frijoles init` writes `GOLDEN_FRIJOLES_URL`, `GOLDEN_FRIJOLES_FLAG_READ_KEY` and
`GOLDEN_FRIJOLES_ENVIRONMENT` into `.env.local` (mode `0600`), adds that file to `.gitignore` — or
refuses — and prints the `@golden-frijoles/sdk` snippet that reads exactly those names.

## What it deliberately does not do

- **Send events.** That is the SDK's path (`@golden-frijoles/sdk`), and a second one would be a
  parallel pipeline.
- **Experiments, journeys, north star, scenarios, destinations, breakers.** Out of v1 on purpose.
- **A TUI.** Plain output and `--json`.
- **Plans and quotas.** Every account is unlimited today; `frijoles` will learn about plans when there is
  a plan to learn about.
