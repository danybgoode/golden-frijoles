// golden-frijoles-cli · Sprint 1, Story 1.4 — `frijoles init`. The whole onboarding in one verb.
//
// ── What it does, in order, and why that order ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//   1. make sure the account has a project (idempotent — D9)
//   2. make sure `.env.local` is ignored by git, or REFUSE
//   3. mint a `flag_read` key for the chosen environment, unless the file already has a live one
//   4. write `.env.local` at 0600
//   5. print the snippet that reads exactly the names it just wrote
//
// Step 2 comes before step 3 on purpose. Minting first and then discovering the file would be
// committed leaves a live credential on disk in a tracked file, and "we minted it but could not
// protect it" is not a state a tool should be able to reach. The shaping named this as a rabbit
// hole: *"`init` must add the env file to `.gitignore` or refuse."*
//
// ── D6: the names are `GOLDEN_FRIJOLES_*`, and the snippet is generated WITH the file ─────────
// The SDK reads no environment variable at all — `createFlagProvider` takes `flagReadKey` as an
// argument, and the `GOLDEN_BEANS_*` names appear only in README examples. They are caller-owned
// addresses, so there is no compatibility to preserve and nothing in shipped code resolves either
// name. What matters is that the file and its reader agree, so both come out of `ENV_KEYS` below.

/**
 * Does this `flag_read` key still resolve a snapshot?
 *
 * Exercised against `/api/v1/flags/snapshot` — the route that actually serves it — because that is
 * the only thing that can answer the question. The key is sent as its own Bearer credential; the
 * CLI's PAT is not involved and must not be, since a PAT authorizes different things entirely.
 *
 * Three answers, and the third is the one that matters:
 *   `live`              — the snapshot resolved AND names the environment being set up.
 *   `dead`              — 401. Unknown, revoked or expired; the caller mints a replacement.
 *   `wrong-environment` — it resolves, but for a DIFFERENT environment. A `flag_read` key is scoped
 *                         to one, so keeping it would pair a production config with a development
 *                         credential and say nothing.
 *   `unverified`  — anything else: a 404 because flag serving is switched off on this deployment,
 *                   a network failure, a proxy. **Reported, never guessed at.** Treating an
 *                   unanswerable question as `dead` would mint a fresh credential on every run of a
 *                   deployment with serving off, which breaks the idempotency this verb promises;
 *                   treating it as `live` silently would repeat the defect this check exists to fix.
