// golden-frijoles-cli — the command table. `--help` is rendered from it and the dispatcher reads it,
// so a verb cannot exist undocumented and cannot be documented without existing.
//
// ORDER IS THE HELP'S ORDER. It runs roughly in the sequence a new user meets them: sign in, find
// your project, set the project up, then work with flags.
