// golden-frijoles-cli · Sprint 1, Story 1.1 — the command shape, and the context every verb gets.
//
// ── One table, and `--help` is RENDERED from it ───────────────────────────────────────────────
// The help text is not written anywhere. It is generated from the same array the dispatcher reads,
// so a verb cannot exist without being documented and cannot be documented without existing — and
// the golden file (D5) then pins the rendered result. The failure this prevents is ordinary and
// constant: a flag added to a handler and not to its help, which an agent then never learns about.
//
// ── Why a handler returns an exit code instead of calling process.exit ────────────────────────
// So the whole CLI can be run in-process by a test, with a captured writer and an injected `fetch`,
// and asserted on its exit code and its exact bytes. A handler that exits the process is a handler
// that can only be tested by spawning one.
