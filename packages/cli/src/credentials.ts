// golden-frijoles-cli · Sprint 1, Story 1.2 — where the token lives on disk.
//
// ── `0600`, and the directory `0700` ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// This file holds a credential that signs its holder in to every project they belong to. The
// shaping named the failure: "key material on disk — 0600, never in the repo, never echoed by
// doctor". The mode is applied at WRITE time on every write, not only at creation, so a file whose
// permissions were loosened by hand is tightened the next time `frijoles login` runs.
//
// ── Precedence: env var, then flag, then file ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `GOLDEN_FRIJOLES_TOKEN` wins, because CI has no credentials file and must not be made to write
// one — a CI job that writes a token to `$HOME` leaves it in whatever the runner caches. The file
// is the interactive path.
//
// ⚠️ `--token` on the command line is accepted and deliberately NOT documented as the way to log
// in: `argv` is visible to every process on the machine and lands in shell history. `frijoles login` with
// no flag reads stdin instead, which does neither.

/**
 * What a CLI token looks like.
 *
 * ⚠️ **A SECOND copy of a regex that also lives in `apps/web/lib/cli-tokens.ts`, and the duplication
 * is deliberate.** This package is published to npm and cannot import from the app; the alternative
 * — no local check at all — costs a network round-trip to tell someone their paste was truncated,
 * which is `frijoles doctor`'s single most useful answer.
 *
 * It is safe to duplicate because of what it is used FOR on each side. Here it is a HINT: a
 * malformed token is reported early, and a token this rejects would have been rejected by the
 * server anyway. There it is the lookup's own shape guard. The failure mode of drift is that this
 * copy becomes stricter than the server (a valid token refused locally, which `frijoles --token` bypasses
 * and `doctor` names) — never that an invalid one is accepted, because this side grants nothing.
