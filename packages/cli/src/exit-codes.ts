// golden-frijoles-cli · Sprint 1, Story 1.1 — the exit codes, as named constants.
//
// ── Why an enum and not `process.exit(1)` at forty call sites ─────────────────────────────────
// The point of this CLI is that an agent drives it. An agent branches on the exit code, and a shell
// script branches on nothing else at all. So the codes are a CONTRACT — pinned by a golden file
// (D5), printed by `frijoles --help`, and named here once so a new verb cannot invent a meaning for `4`
// that disagrees with every other verb's `4`.
//
// ── Why these seven, and no more ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Each one exists because a caller would do something DIFFERENT about it. That is the test for
// adding an eighth: if the remedy is the same, it is the same code.
//
//   USAGE      — fix the command. Nothing was sent.
//   AUTH       — log in again. The credential is not accepted.
//   NOT_FOUND  — the thing is not there, or is not yours. Deliberately one code: "not yours" and
//                "not there" are indistinguishable by design (AGENTS #10), so an exit code that
//                told them apart would leak what the API refuses to.
//   CONFLICT   — someone else moved it. Re-read and retry. This is the one an agent can RESOLVE by
//                itself, which is why it must not collapse into SERVER.
//   PARTIAL    — D2. Some environments changed and some did not. Not a success and not a clean
//                failure, and a CLI with no code for it forces the caller to parse prose.
//   SERVER     — the server or the network is unwell. RETRY; do not mint anything new.
