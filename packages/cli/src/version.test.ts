// The version constant and the manifest must agree, and the unit gate is where that is caught.
//
// `VERSION` is a literal because a runtime `require('../package.json')` resolves differently from
// `src/` and from `dist/`, and silently returns `undefined` on a packaging change — printing
// `frijoles undefined` to whoever asked which version they have. A literal cannot do that; what it CAN do
// is drift, so this is the assertion that stops it.
//
// ⚠️ It also pins the published `bin`. `frijoles` is the name the epic, the installer and every document
// promise, and a manifest that renamed it would ship a package whose one-line install instruction
// is wrong — with nothing else in the repo able to notice.
