// golden-frijoles-cli · Sprint 1, Story 1.1 — the argument parser. PURE, and no dependency.
//
// ── Why hand-written and not `commander`/`yargs` ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// A published CLI's dependency tree is its install time and its supply-chain surface, and this one
// is meant to be reached with `npx` on a machine that has never seen it. The whole grammar here is
// "verbs, then `--flag value`", which is forty lines. A parser library would be the largest thing
// in the package by an order of magnitude, to save those forty lines.
//
// ── Pure, so the contract can be asserted without spawning anything ───────────────────────────
// Every parsing rule below is tested directly (CODE-QUALITY #5). Spawning `frijoles` to find out whether
// `--percent` accepts `=` is a test that also exercises the network, the filesystem and a token.

  // "anywhere") got a success code and none of the output it asked for.
